<h2 class="anchor" id="layouts">NOT PERFECT, BUT PERFECT FOR ME?</h2>

<h3 class="anchor" id="2b-or-not-2b">To Be, Or Not To Be?</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned, I've used the Colemak layout for 18 years or so. Before that, I used the Dvorak layout for some years.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		I've been very happy with Colemak for all these years. I'm sure you could, too.
    </li><li>
		At the same time, I don't regret the upgrade from Dvorak. So there <i>can</i> be value in a change.
    </li><li>
		People tend to spend a lot of time and effort on finding the right layout for them.
    </li><li>
		Too little (settling for a subpar layout) and too much (tiresome layout hopping) should both be avoided.
    </li><li>
		While nearly anything beats the proverbial crap out of QWERTY, ...
    </li><li>
		It isn't easy to navigate the waters of alt layouts.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4 class="anchor" id="so-much-to-choose-from">So Much To Choose From</h4>
<p>
    There's an abundance of newer layouts, keeping less QWERTY similarity and using more metrics than Colemak.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		The test of time has shown Colemak to be a well-made layout. Lots of work went into its design and testing.
    </li><li>
		There are only a few of the newer layouts that are well-tested over time by many experienced layout users.
    </li><li>
		Some think the more metrics the merrier, but at the same time there's still a big need for human assessment.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4 class="anchor" id="priorities">Priorities, Priorities</h4>
<p>
	Differences of priority lead to different ideal choices. Some example points:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		Ease of learning/implementation. Examples: Colemak, Tarmak, Minimak – but that one's way too poorly optimized.
    </li><li>
		One-hand rolls (Colemak etc) vs hand alternation (Graphite/Gallium etc), lateral stretches, redirects ...
    </li><li>
		To some extent, hardware/software options. For instance, standard implementations vs programmable keyboards.
    </li><li>
		Languages used, and how much of each. For example, `J` is very rare in English but less so in Spanish.
    </li><li>
		What you type in general. Chatting, coding and scientific writing, for instance, are very different things.
    </li><li>
		For most people though, I think that a layout that works well for their main language(s) is the important thing.
    </li><li>
		Anything else, including Vim commands and special characters, are readily done as modular add-ons and layers.
    </li>
</ul><br />

<h3 class="anchor" id="colemak-a-goldilocks-layout">Colemak: A Goldilocks Layout?</h3>
<p>
	My feeling is that Colemak is a very good layout for nearly everyone, as a sweet spot of priorities.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		I've been a very happy Colemak user for nearly two decades. All in all, it's remarkably well made and balanced.
    </li><li>
        It has a good balance of ease of learning and implementation vs optimization.
    </li><li>
        It has a good balance of familiarity and novelty, being well-tested and well-designed.
    </li><li>
        It has good hardware and software support, and an active and helpful community.
    </li><li>
		Decide on "Vanilla" vs DH, and whether to add further mods (see <a href="https://colemak.org/">colemak.org</a>). Most implementations are ready-made.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<p>
	Compared to other worthy alternatives, Colemak is easy to learn.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        It keeps rarely used letters in their old positions, without losing anything important.
    </li><li>
        It keeps punctuation in old positions, but you can opt for an add-on Sym ergo mod should you wish.
    </li><li>
        It keeps ZXCV in place, which may or may not matter to you; it's a relatively harmless design choice.
    </li><li>
        The Tarmak transitional layouts allow you to learn Colemak in up to five "baby" steps, should you wish to.
    </li><li>
        If ease of learning and/or implementation matter to you, Colemak is definitely my suggestion.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<img alt="The Colemak-DH layout" src="res/div/Layouts/Colemak-DH_Orth-Cpt_EPKL.png" />
<p class="img-text">
    <a href="https://colemak.org/"><b>Colemak(-DH)</b></a> is the layout I've been using for nearly two decades. So nice.
</p>
<p>
	For its design limitations, Colemak keeps a very nice set of metrics, well suited for most users.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        Relative to several other popular layouts, Colemak has many rolls, which feels nice and flowy.
    </li><li>
        A slight downside is that more rolls usually leads to more suboptimal patterns such as redirects/pinballs.
    </li><li>
        Most issues that newer layouts try to solve, I've found to be fixable by alt-fingering or easy to live with.
    </li>

	If really set on venturing past Colemak, you could try out <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Graphite#gralmak"><b>Gralmak</b></a>?
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		The Gallium/Graphite/Gralmak layouts are new (2023–2025) and very well optimized.
    </li><li>
		They keep similarities with familiar layouts. This includes row/column assignments, punctuation in Gralmak, etc.
    </li><li>
		Even if you end up wanting even more radical optimization, Gralmak can still be a useful stepping-stone.
    </li><li>
		If after learning Gralmak for a while, you still want to proceed: Go on to full Gallium/Graphite(-HB) or something similar.
    </li>

<h4 class="anchor" id="assessing">Assessing</h4>
<p>
	It's actually really hard to assess a new layout fairly, unless you're an expert – and even if you are one.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
		Every layout has its strong and weak points.
    </li><li>
		You'll feel some good things but ignore some bad ones, and vice versa.
    </li><li>
		It'll take time to understand a layout's features.
    </li><li>
		Especially when they affect typing flow, which you won't have at first.
    </li><li>
		Before you are up to speed, it's not easy to notice what works and what doesn't at your full speed.
    </li><li>
			Not all of us will ever type really fast! So there's that, too.
    </li><li>
			If something's mostly noticeable at, say, 120+ WPM and like me you'll likely never get there, what then?
    </li><li>
		What you've known and used beforehand will significantly influence your experience.

<div class="spoiler"><p><span>Tips For Assessing A New Layout:</span></p><div class="spoiler-body">
    <p><i>Below is a tip from Casuanoob at the Cmk Discord about judging how a new layout really works for you.</i></p><br>
    <h4>Assess Progress Success</h4>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
            Take notes of pain points and annoyances about the layout while getting up to 60 WPM, imo, and ...
        </li><li>
            Make a decision somewhere between 60 and 100.
        </li><li>
            Personally, I ended up making decision points at 80 WPM.
        </li><li>
            I feel like if you go much faster, you end up coping with some things to the point where you forget that you actually disliked them.
        </li><li>
            So maybe not wait until 100, unless you get speed up fast like some people do?
        </li><li>
            There's definitely some gulf in experience between 60 and 80 WPM where you haven't actually started rolling any keys at all, so ...
        </li><li>
            The experience before 60 WPM doesn't actually fully reflect either.
        </li><li>
            Note: Since everyone has different base speed and learn at different paces, obviously the numbers here should be adjusted to your situation.
        </li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><i>Casuanoob's speeds at the time of writing (early 2025) were between 80 WPM for text with punctuation and 110 WPM for 1-minute MT Eng200 tests.</i></p>
</div></div>

<h3 class="anchor" id="summary">Summa Summarum</h3>
<p>
    There is no undisputed king of keyboard layouts, and there won't be. 
</p><p>
    You get to a point where individual preference and usage patterns start to matter more than objective aspects, and then you can't agree on a one-layout-fits-all. 
    I believe we're already about there, pretty much. 
</p><p>
    New tech may yet improve typing, but the main barrier to speed is actually mental load. A really good development should make typing simpler, not more complex. 
</p><p>
    As stated elsewhere, my firm belief is that your time is far better spent on learning to use <a href="/layers-main.html"><b>layers</b></a>, <a href="/ergo-mods.html"><b>mods</b></a> and other tools well than on chasing a mythical "perfect" base layout.
</p>

<!-- h4 class="anchor" id=""></h4 -->
<!-- 
    Delving Too Greedily
    --------------------
    What? Are you still here? I thought I told you to go and learn more about layers and mods!? Ah well...
		[Box: Still, what about all these new layouts, huh? Huh!? Huh?!?]
		Questing For The Gral
        ---------------------
		So, finally my curiosity got the better of me and as a result I did end up trying out one of the newer layouts. 
        Feels really odd after having typed on Colemak for 18 years, I can tell you!

		I've just about reached my Colemak speed on my Graphite variant <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Graphite#gralmak"><b>Gralmak</b></a> now, so I feel that I have an idea of what it's about.
		So far, my main impression is that both Gralmak and Colemak are good, and I won't be getting any substantial gains from the switch – apart from a satisfied curiosity and the fun and pain of trying something new.

		Colemak-DH is a good and well thought-out layout. So is Graphite. The latter takes some factors into consideration that weren't yet considered back in 2014. Fine. But I honestly don't feel major quality-of-life differences (yet?).
		
        Taking Notes
        ------------
		They both have their stronger and weaker points. Some musings:
		- Graphite has some delightful n-grams. More than Colemak, it uses all three rows without much scissoring.
		- Colemak has a nice flow to it and some delightful home row rolls, but also some sticky spots here and there.
		- Colemak does of course have more redirects than Graphite. Notable examples are YOU, and WAS. More rolls makes for more redirects.
		
		- Typing `YOU` isn't great on either, it's just a little easier on Graphite.
			- It's a redirect (QWERTY `O;I`) on Colemak, and a lateral stretch (QWERTY `HIO`) on Graphite/Gralmak.
			- I've heard layout designers say that it's hard to make that word good on a good layout.
		- Writing `PHY` is worse on Graphite. I'm a phycisist, so I know. Every layout has some words that don't agree well with it.
		- For some awkward bigrams, alt-fingering helps a lot. Colemak `KN KL` and Graphite `SC SW PH` are good examples. This takes time to learn well.
		- Others just have to be tanked, pretty much.
			- For example, `UE/EU` is a bad SFB pair on both layouts – and on several other good layouts, too.
			- It's worse on Graphite/Gallium as it uses the ring finger there vs middle on Colemak.
			- Luckily, it's not too common as it's hard to alt-finger well on either layout.
		- You will get used to a number of weakish spots with time and experience, as long as they aren't too common.
		- If you start overthinking such weak spots though, I believe you won't be able to judge a layout fairly. I think this happens to many.

		- It won't matter to all, but Colemak is still easier to learn with more QWERTY and shortcut similarities.
		- Colemak keeping ZXCV in place is an asset to some, and so is the Tarmak learning method for gradual learning.
		- Using the Gralmak variant though, the bottom row goes ZXMCV and that's really no worse than Colemak-DH's ZXCDV.
		
        A Personal Fable
        ----------------
        This is a personal story from my Gralmak learning journey. I think it illustrates how easy it is to get hung up on something!
        [Box: Stretching The Truth]
		- After learning the layout for a while, I felt that Graphite has more lateral stretching than Colemak-DH?
        - The NG/GN bigram is a stretch (LSB). GT/TG leads to a lot of alt-fingering to avoid the LSB.
        - Note that this was based on a feeling! I didn't have the analysis for it, so I didn't really know.
        - So I looked at some recent analyzers, and they of course all agree that ...
        - Colemak-DH has in fact significantly more LSBs than Graphite/Gralmak. Duh.
        - They all calculate lateral stretches differently, so numbers varied widely, but ...
        - Most on them agreed on 30–45% more LSBs for Colemak-DH.
        - Cyanophage's analyzer and GalileoBlues' KeySolve 2 agreed that ...
        - The most common LSBs for Graphite/Gralmak are `YO AY AK`, and for Cmk-DH `ME KE EM`.
        - I agree that Colemak-DH `ME EM` is uncomfortable, but `KE` isn't bad. 
        - Alt-fingering `ME EM` by sliding the ring finger in solves the issue.
        - On Graphite, I intuitively alt-finger `YO AY AK` making them quite acceptable.
        - Again: This story illustrates how easy it is to get hung up on something!
        - Such somethings are very noticeable once you focus on them, but ...
        - Choices made from such impressions may be very misleading.

		A Battle Of Elements
        --------------------
        As for Graphite vs the very similar Gallium, I've tried both.
		- Gralmak ended up with a sort of mix between them and some Colemak principles.
		- Like Colemak, I keep the symbol keys unchanged, instead using my Sym mod and special keys.
		- The symbols being familiar makes it easier to learn, too.
		- I prefer J in the middle and apostrophe on the side, like Gallium and Colemak have.
		- Again, similarity with what you already know aids learning and use.
		- For added familiarity and convenience, I put Z back into its corner in Gralmak.
		- Swapping Z and Q has next to no negative impact on layout quality, and it just feels and looks right.
		- The only other letter difference between Gallium and Graphite (apart from the rare ZXQ), is `CV` vs `WZ` on the upper vs lower row.
		- I first wanted to go with Gal to make the `SC` bigram easier, but now I'm on board with Graphite keeping `W` on top and `CV` on the lower row.
		- This is mainly because those are more in line with what we're used to. In the long run, that's not a strong argument, but it makes transitions easier.
		- The bigrams involved are fine either way, really.
		
        Here Be Dragons
        ---------------
		Some comments on Gralmak vs even newer layouts:
		- In the AKL society and other places, there's always some layout names flying around. Every now and then, they change.
		- There's very little actual proof for and experience with most of the alternatives.
		- Some have a little better stats in one or more categories. What that actually translates to, is still somewhat open.
		- There's been a lot of talk lately about rolls vs alternation.
		- The pendulum swung towards alternation because of redirects on rolly layouts. But there are some quite rolly layouts with lower redirects now.
		- While it will be interesting to follow further developments, I feel that nothing is conclusive for now.
		- In sum, I feel fine about sticking with Colemak(-DH) for 18 years. So I'm not going to worry about catching up on even later developments at the moment!
