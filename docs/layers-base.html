<h2 class="anchor" id="intro">NOT PERFECT, BUT PERFECT FOR ME?</h2>
<p>
    The <b>Base Layout</b> is your unmodified (and shifted) keyboard layout. 
    In the narrowest sense, it may be just the main letter block of 3 rows by 2×5 columns.
</p><p>
    Below is a teaser of some popular layout alternatives over the years. Mouse-over to see their names.

<h3 class="anchor" id="2b-or-not-2b">To Be, Or Not To Be?</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned, I've used the Colemak layout for 18 years or so. Before that, I used the Dvorak layout for some years.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        I've been very happy with Colemak for all these years. I'm sure you could, too.
    </li><li>
        At the same time, I don't regret the upgrade from Dvorak. So there <i>can</i> be value in a change.
    </li><li>
        People tend to spend a lot of time and effort on finding the right layout for them.
    </li><li>
        Too little (settling for a subpar layout) and too much (tiresome layout hopping) should both be avoided.
    </li><li>
        While nearly anything beats the proverbial crap out of QWERTY, ...
    </li><li>
        <b>It isn't easy to navigate the waters of alt layouts.</b>
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4 class="anchor" id="so-much-to-choose-from">So Much To Choose From</h4>
<p>
    There's an abundance of newer layouts, keeping less QWERTY similarity and using more metrics than Colemak.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        The test of time has shown Colemak to be a well-made layout. Lots of work went into its design and testing.
    </li><li>
        There are only a few of the newer layouts that are well-tested over time by many experienced layout users.
    </li><li>
        Some think the more metrics the merrier, but at the same time there's still a big need for human assessment.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4 class="anchor" id="priorities">Priorities, Priorities</h4>
<p>
    Differences of priority lead to different ideal choices. Some example points:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        Ease of learning/implementation. Examples: Colemak, Tarmak, Minimak – but that one's way too poorly optimized.
    </li><li>
        One-hand rolls (Colemak, Canary, ...) vs hand alternation (Gallium, Graphite, ...), lateral stretches, redirects ...
    </li><li>
        To some extent, hardware/software options. For instance, standard implementations vs programmable keyboards.
    </li><li>
        What languages you use, and how much of each. For example, `J` is very rare in English but less so in Spanish.
    </li><li>
        What you type in general. Chatting, coding and scientific writing, for instance, are very different things.
    </li><li>
        For most of us though, I think that <b>a layout that works well for your main language(s) is the important thing.</b>
    </li><li>
        Anything else, including Vim commands and special characters, are readily done as modular add-ons and layers.
    </li>
</ul><br />

<h3 class="anchor" id="colemak-a-goldilocks-layout">Colemak: A Goldilocks Layout?</h3>
<p>
    My feeling is that Colemak is a very good layout for nearly everyone, as a sweet spot of priorities.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        I've been a very happy Colemak user for nearly two decades. All in all, it's remarkably well made and balanced.
    </li><li>
        It has a good balance of ease of learning and implementation vs optimization.
    </li><li>
        It has a good balance of familiarity and novelty, being well-tested and well-designed.
    </li><li>
        It has good hardware and software support, and an active and helpful community.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Decide on "Vanilla" vs DH, and whether to add further mods (see <a href="https://colemak.org/">colemak.org</a>). Most implementations are ready-made.
</p><p>
    Compared to other worthy alternatives, Colemak is easy to learn.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        It keeps rarely used letters in their old positions, without losing anything important.
    </li><li>
        It keeps punctuation in old positions – but you can opt for an add-on Sym ergo mod should you wish.
    </li><li>
        It keeps ZXCV in place, which may or may not matter to you; it's a relatively harmless design choice.
    </li><li>
        The Tarmak transitional layouts allow you to learn Colemak in up to five "baby" steps, should you wish to.
    </li><li>
        If ease of learning and/or implementation matter to you, Colemak is definitely my suggestion.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<img alt="The Colemak-DH layout" src="res/div/Layouts/Colemak-DH_Orth-Cpt_EPKL.png" />
<p class="img-text">
    <a href="https://colemak.org/"><b>Colemak(-DH)</b></a> is the layout I've been using for nearly two decades. So nice.
</p>
<p>
    For its design limitations, Colemak keeps a very nice set of metrics, well suited for most users.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        Relative to several other popular layouts, Colemak has many rolls, which feels nice and flowy.
    </li><li>
        A slight downside is that more rolls usually leads to more suboptimal patterns such as redirects/pinballs.
    </li><li>
        Most issues that newer layouts try to solve, I've found to be fixable by alt-fingering or easy to live with.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4 class="anchor" id="gralmak">Delving Deeper</h4>
<p>
    If really set on venturing past Colemak, you could try out <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Graphite#gralmak"><b>Gralmak</b></a>?
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Gallium">Gallium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Graphite">Graphite</a> 
        and Gralmak layouts are recent (2023–2025) and very well optimized.
    </li><li>
        I find it fascinating how two layout designers wanting to improve on the Sturdy layout, ended up with practically the same layout independently.
    </li><li>
        They keep some similarity with familiar layouts. This includes row/column assignments, punctuation in Gralmak, etc.
    </li><li>
        Even if you end up wanting even more radical optimization, Gralmak can still be a useful stepping-stone.
    </li><li>
        If after learning Gralmak for a while, you still want to proceed: Go on to full Gallium/Graphite(-HB) or something similar.
    </li>

    I said it above, and I'll say it again: 
</p>
<blockquote>
    <b><i>I don't wish for anyone to keep hopping around the rabbit hole of alt layouts any more than they have to.</b></i>

<p>
    However, some people just have a lot of hop in them! And some have lots of time, energy and motivation to explore.

<h4 class="anchor" id="assessing">Assessing</h4>
<p>
    It's actually really hard to assess a new layout fairly, unless you're an expert – and even if you are one.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        Every layout has its strong and weak points.
    </li><li>
        You'll feel some good things but ignore some bad ones, and vice versa.
    </li><li>
        What you've known and used beforehand will significantly influence your experience.
    </li><li>
        It'll take time to understand a layout's features.
    </li><li>
        Especially when they affect typing flow, which you won't have at first.
    </li><li>
        Before you are up to speed, it's not easy to notice what works and what doesn't at your full speed.
    </li><li>
            Not all of us will ever type really fast! So there's that, too.
    </li><li>
            If something's mostly noticeable at, say, 120+ WPM and like me you'll likely never get there, what then?
    </li>
</ul><br />
<div class="spoiler"><p><span>Tips For Assessing A New Layout:</span></p><div class="spoiler-body">
    <p><i>Below is a tip from Casuanoob at the Cmk Discord about judging how a new layout really works for you.</i></p><br>
    <h4>Assess Progress Success</h4>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
            Take notes of pain points and annoyances about the layout while getting up to 60 WPM, in my opinion, and ...
        </li><li>
            Make a decision somewhere between 60 and 100 WPM. I ended up making decisions at 80 WPM.
        </li><li>
            I feel like if you go much faster, you end up coping with some things to the point where you forget that you actually disliked them.
        </li><li>
            So maybe not wait until 100, unless you get speed up fast like some people do?
        </li><li>
            There's definitely some gulf in experience between 60 and 80 WPM where you haven't actually started rolling any keys at all.
        </li><li>
            So the experience before 60 WPM doesn't actually fully reflect anything useful either.
        </li><li>
            Note: Since everyone has different base speed and learn at different paces, obviously the numbers here should be adjusted to your situation.
        </li>
    </ul><br />
    <p>  <i>Casuanoob's speeds at the time of writing (early 2025) were: 
        <br>80 WPM for text with punctuation and 110 WPM for 1-minute MT Eng200 tests.</i></p>
</div></div>

<h3 class="anchor" id="summary">Summa Summarum</h3>
<p>
    There is no undisputed king of keyboard layouts, and I don't think there will ever be one. 
</p><p>
    You get to a point where individual preference and usage patterns start to matter more than objective aspects, and then you can't agree on a one-layout-fits-all. 
    I believe we're already about there, pretty much. 
</p><p>
    New tech may yet improve typing, but the main barrier to speed is actually mental load. A really good development should make typing simpler, not more complex. 
</p><p>
    As stated elsewhere, my firm belief is that your time is far better spent on learning to use <a href="/layers-main.html"><b>layers</b></a>, <a href="/ergo-mods.html"><b>mods</b></a> and other tools well than on chasing a mythical "perfect" base layout.
</p>

<h3 class="anchor" id="delving-too-greedily">Delving Too Greedily</h3>
<p>
    What? Are you still here? I thought I told you to go and learn more about <a href="/layers-main.html"><b>layers</b></a> and <a href="/ergo-mods.html"><b>mods</b></a>!?
</p><br />
<div class="spoiler"><p><span>Still, what about all these new layouts, huh? Huh!? Huh?!?</span></p><div class="spoiler-body">
    <h4 class="anchor" id="questing-for-the-gral">Questing For The Gral</h4>
    <p>
        Ah well, so ... 
        Finally my curiosity got the better of me and as a result I did end up trying out one of the newer layouts. 
        Feels really odd after having typed on Colemak for 18 years, I can tell you!
    </p><p>
        I've just about reached my Colemak speed on my Graphite variant <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Layouts/Graphite#gralmak"><b>Gralmak</b></a>, so I feel that I have an idea of what it's about. 
        So far, my main impression is that both Gralmak and Colemak are good, and I won't be getting any substantial gains from the switch – apart from a satisfied curiosity and the fun and pain of trying something new.
    </p><p>
        Colemak-DH is a good and well thought-out layout. So is Graphite. 
        The latter takes some factors into consideration that weren't yet considered back in 2014. Fine. But I honestly don't feel major quality-of-life differences – yet?

    <h4 class="anchor" id="taking-notes">Taking Notes</h4>
    <p>
        Colemak and Graphite/Gralmak both have their stronger and weaker points. Some personal musings:
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
            Graphite has some delightful n-grams. More than Colemak, it uses all three rows without much scissoring.
        </li><li>
            Colemak has a nice flow to it and some delightful home row rolls, but also some sticky spots here and there.
        </li><li>
            Colemak does of course have more redirects than Graphite. 
            Notable examples are <kbd>YOU</kbd>, and <kbd>WAS</kbd>. 
            More rolls makes for more redirects.
        </li><br /><li>
            Typing <kbd>YOU</kbd> isn't great on either, it's just a little easier on Graphite.
        <ul class="disc"><li>
                It's a redirect (QWERTY <kbd>O;I</kbd>) on Colemak, 
                and a lateral stretch (QWERTY <kbd>HIO</kbd>) on Graphite/Gralmak.
            </li><li>
                I've heard layout designers say that it's hard to make that word good on a good layout.
        </li></ul><li>
            Writing <kbd>PHY</kbd> is worse on Graphite. I'm a phycisist, so I know. 
            Every layout has some words that don't agree well with it.
        </li><br /><li>
            For some awkward bigrams, alt-fingering helps a lot. 
            Colemak <kbd>KN KL</kbd> and Graphite <kbd>SC SW PH</kbd> are good examples. 
            This takes time to learn well.
        </li><li>
            Others just have to be tanked, pretty much.
        <ul class="disc"><li>
                For example, <kbd>UE/EU</kbd> is a bad SFB pair on both layouts – and on several other good layouts, too.
            </li><li>
                It's worse on Graphite/Gallium as it uses the ring finger there vs middle on Colemak.
            </li><li>
                Luckily, it's not too common as it's hard to alt-finger well on either layout.
        </li></ul><li>
            You will get used to a number of weakish spots with time and experience, as long as they aren't too common.
        </li><li>
            If you start overthinking such weak spots though, I believe you won't be able to judge a layout fairly. I think this happens to many.
        </li><br /><li>
            It won't matter to all, but Colemak is still easier to learn with more QWERTY and shortcut similarities. 
        </li><li>
            This may also aid transitions between QWERTY and your alt layout, but peoples' opinions vary on that.
        </li><li>
            Colemak keeping ZXCV in place is an asset to some, and so is the Tarmak learning method for gradual learning.
        </li><li>
            Using the Gralmak variant though, the bottom row goes ZXMCV and that's really no worse than Colemak-DH's ZXCDV.
        </li>
    </ul><br />
    <h4 class="anchor" id="a-personal-fable">A Personal Fable</h4>
    <p>
        This is a personal story from my Gralmak learning journey. I think it illustrates how easy it is to get hung up on something!
    </p>
    <div class="spoiler"><p><span>Stretching The Truth</span></p><div class="spoiler-body">
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
            After learning the layout for a while, I felt that Graphite has more lateral stretching than Colemak-DH?
        </li><li>
            The <kbd>NG/GN</kbd> bigram is a stretch (LSB). <kbd>GT/TG</kbd> leads to a lot of alt-fingering to avoid the LSB.
        </li><li>
            Note that this was based on a feeling! I didn't have the analysis for it, so I didn't really know.
        </li><li>
            So I looked at some recent analyzers, and they of course all agree that ...
        </li><li>
            Colemak-DH has in fact significantly more LSBs than Graphite/Gralmak. Duh.
        </li><li>
            They all calculate lateral stretches differently, so numbers varied widely, but ...
        </li><li>
            Most on them agreed on 30–45% more LSBs for Colemak-DH.
        </li><li>
            Cyanophage's analyzer and GalileoBlues' KeySolve 2 agreed that ...
        </li><li>
            The most common LSBs for Graphite/Gralmak are <kbd>YO AY AK</kbd>, and for Cmk-DH <kbd>ME KE EM</kbd>.
        </li><li>
            I agree that Colemak-DH <kbd>ME EM</kbd> is uncomfortable, but <kbd>KE</kbd> isn't bad. 
        </li><li>
            Alt-fingering <kbd>ME EM</kbd> by sliding the ring finger in solves the issue.
        </li><li>
            On Graphite, I intuitively alt-finger <kbd>YO AY AK</kbd> making them quite acceptable.

            Such somethings are very noticeable once you focus on them, but ...

            Choices made from such impressions may be very misleading.

    <p>
        As for Graphite vs the very similar Gallium layout, I've tried both.
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
        	Gralmak ended up with a sort of mix between them and some Colemak principles.
        </li><li>
        	Like Colemak, I keep the symbol keys unchanged, instead using my Sym mod and special keys.
        </li><li>
        	The symbols staying in their familiar positions makes it easier to learn.
        </li><li>
        	I prefer <kbd>J</kbd> in the middle and apostrophe on the side, like Gallium and Colemak have.
        </li><li>
        	For added familiarity and convenience, I put <kbd>ZX</kbd> back into its corner in Gralmak.
        </li><li>
        	Swapping <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> has no discernible negative impact on layout quality, 
            and it just feels and looks right.
        </li><li>
        	Apart from the rare <kbd>ZXQ</kbd>, the only other letter difference between Gallium and Graphite is 
            <kbd>CV</kbd> vs <kbd>WZ</kbd> on the upper vs lower row.
        </li><li>
        	I first went with Gallium to make the <kbd>SC</kbd> bigram a bit easier, but now ...
        </li><li>
            I prefer Graphite's keeping <kbd>W</kbd> on top and <kbd>CV</kbd> on the lower row.
        </li><li>
        	This is mainly because those assignments are more in line with what we're used to. 
        </li><li>
            In the long run, that's not a strong argument, but it makes transitions easier.
        </li><li>
        	The bigrams involved are fine either way, really.
        </li>
    </ul><br />

        My current take on Graphite/Gralmak vs even newer layouts:
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>
            In the AKL society and other places, there's always some layout names flying around. 
        </li><li>
            Every now and then, the "soup-du-jour" changes.
        </li><li>
            There's very little actual proof for and experience with most of the alternatives.
        </li><li>
            Some have a little better stats in one or more categories. 
        </li><li>
            What that actually translates to, is still somewhat open.
        </li><li>
            There's been much talk lately about rolls vs alternation.
        </li><li>
            A while back, the pendulum swung towards alternation because of redirects on rolly layouts.
        </li><li>
            However, there are some quite rolly layouts with lower redirects now.
        </li><li>
            While it will be interesting to follow further developments, I feel that nothing is conclusive at this point.
        </li><li>
            In sum, I feel perfectly fine about sticking with Colemak(-DH) for 18 years.
        </li><li>
            Hence, I'm not going to worry about catching up on even later developments at the moment!
        </li>
    </ul>
