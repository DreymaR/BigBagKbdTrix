    <a class="bold" href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/alt-layouts/index.html">"A guide to alt keyboard layouts"</a> by Pascal Getreuer is a good read if you're wondering what other good layouts are out there. In particular, he covers and explains some of the newest layouts that use modern metrics like redirects (back-and-forth), lateral stretches and disjointed bigrams. And he has a nice diagram showcasing the evolution of such layouts from 1873 to the present day; granted, only showing one analyzer's take on it, but a good one.

If you want an easier read, the Hackaday article <a class="bold" href="https://hackaday.com/2016/03/15/the-origin-of-qwerty/">"The Origin Of QWERTY"</a> sums it up neatly with pretty pictures and whatnot. There are many myths and this paper deals with them. Quote: "The keyboard [...] changed into QWERTY, first to receive telegraphs, then to thrash out a compromise between inventors and producers..."

    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#History">QWERTY layout predecessor</a> from 1870. Keys that are the same in today's QWERTY are marked in gray.<br>
    Note how the vowels and consonants were simply sorted alphabetically, the right-hand top and the bottom row in reverse.

The relationship between chording (such as holding Ctrl+Shift then hitting a key) and sequences (such as hitting one or more dead keys and/or a sticky shift then another key) is worth giving a thought.
