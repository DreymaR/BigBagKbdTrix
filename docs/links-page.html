    The Verge has a nice article on <a class="bold" href="https://www.theverge.com/23623723/touch-typing-keyboard-home-row-qwerty-dvorak-colemak-how-to">how to touch type</a>. It showcases several good sites and games, and contains sound advice as far as I can see.

    "<a class="bold" href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/alt-layouts/index.html">A guide to alt keyboard layouts</a>" by Pascal Getreuer is a good read if you're wondering what other good layouts are out there. In particular, he covers and explains some of the newest layouts that use modern metrics like redirects (back-and-forth), lateral stretches and disjointed bigrams. And he has a nice diagram showcasing the evolution of such layouts from 1873 to the present day; granted, only showing one analyzer's take on it, but a good one.

    "<a class="bold" href="https://bit.ly/alt-layouts-quickstart">Alt Layouts Quickstart</a>" (Google doc) is another great read for getting to know the ins and outs of alt layouts. It largely represents the views of the <a class="bold" href="discord.gg/2qq8qmDtFf">AKL Discord</a> community, which is dedicated to everything Alt Keyboard Layouts and holds many of the top layout designers of today.

     "<a class="bold" href="https://hackaday.com/2016/03/15/the-origin-of-qwerty/">The Origin Of QWERTY</a>" gives a credible and interesting account of how QWERTY came to be back in the late 1800s, with pretty pictures to boot. It's based, among other things, on the scientific paper "<a class="bold" href="https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/139379/1/42_161.pdf">On the Prehistory of QWERTY</a>" (PDF format). There are many myths around, and this paper deals with them. The actual design was much more about optimizing for U.S. telegraphists and a little about a compromise between inventors and producers; not, as is commonly believed, mainly a way of avoiding key jams!

    "<a class="bold" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47460499">How did the QWERTY keyboard become so popular?</a>" is a more popularized BBC News article on QWERTY history, with some Dvorak added.

    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#History">QWERTY layout predecessor</a> from 1870. Keys that are the same in today's QWERTY are marked in gray.<br>
    Note how vowels and consonants were simply sorted in alphabetical order, left-right then right-left.

    "<a class="bold" href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/banish_key_chords.html">Banish Key Chords</a>" by Xah Lee. The relationship between chording (such as holding Ctrl+Shift then hitting a key) and sequences (such as hitting one or more dead keys and/or a sticky shift then another key) is worth giving a thought.
