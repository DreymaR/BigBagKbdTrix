    This page contains tips and tricks for training your typing skills, and links to other sites and programs including the amazing Amphetype. Whether you're new to the layout and just want to learn it properly to get by with less confusion, or an advanced speed monster who wants to make that next <b>P</b>ersonal <b>B</b>est, there should be something useful for you here. Let's start off with some words from the wise before delving into my tools and tricks:

<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        <b>Good training should be varied</b>! Don't wear yourself out by banging your head against a hurdle until you're exhausted, but keep chipping away at it now and then.
    </li><li>
        Remember to take <b>breaks</b> and do stretching and loosening <b>exercises</b> for your arms and wrists. Circulation is important, and you do not want RSI!
    </li><li>
        Many <b>shorter bouts</b> in a day beats a few long ones. <b>Sleep</b> can also be remarkably effective for processing your progress!
    </li><li>
        Typing experts all seem to value the ability to <b>vary your speed</b>. Type well-known words blazingly fast, and slow down a bit for hard ones to avoid mistakes. Mistakes will slow you down more than consciously slowing down will, once you get used to it!
    </li><li>
        Wise words from <b>200+ WPM typist Sophie</b> at the Colemak Discord on how to progress past 100 WPM – useful for other speeds too:
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="quote">
<p>
    <b>Sophie said:</b> <br>
    When I was around 80 WPM I used to use Ctrl+Backspace to delete the entire previous incorrect word to give my muscle memory another shot at typing the thing out as a whole, and sort of like a tiny little self-punishment that made me not want to mess up after long sessions. But there was a point I definitely had to learn to stop stressing so much and pausing over my mistakes and just, in a way, hope I didn't miss.
</p><p>
    I think it's really important to try to type a word [part] as one whole action instead of individual letters to get past 100. A good way to practice typing out whole words is to have a bit of fun messing around planning out your fingerings for each word, even if you have to pause on each spacebar for 2–3 or even 4 seconds. It's a good way to get a feel for how typing super fast feels without having to maintain a high WPM and just good practice at the "one word one action" kinda thing. Then maybe if that starts to get comfortable you could try 2 words in a row, and so on. Once you get the words ingrained like that, it's pretty much just a case of staying calm and spacebarring faster.
</p><p>
    At the 90–120 WPM range it starts to become less about hitting single buttons fast consciously and more about a relaxed state of mind, your subconscious mind, and achieving a steady mental flow. Around 100 WPM is certainly not a speed that requires you to stress your fingers in any way, it's still at that point very much a mental challenge rather than physical.
</p><p>
    Your mind and hands should both be relaxed – although if they start aching a little bit, like workout pain, this is good; you're building some raw strength. Some people say this is bad but I believe you can distinguish between a good pain for strength building and a bad pain for damaging yourself. I found my right pinky usage made my forearm ache for a while til I got it up to speed with the other fingers.
</p><p>
    It's only when I type about 220 WPM raw speed I feel like I'm stressing my hands and that it's becoming a physical challenge. But I also have a long way to go in mastering my mindset and staying calm and just improving my typing in general. But yeah – I don't think there's really much physical challenge in achieving 200 WPM with Colemak so just stay calm, and most importantly enjoy your progress! Also experiment and have fun with bursting fast or whatever. You don't have to type rhythmically at the same pace for every word and key combination. Water can flow or it can crash, be water my friend...
</p>
</div>
<p>
    Sophie's tips are in accord with what other expert typists have said. But with the added advice of being water! _/|\_

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="otherTips">OTHER TIPS</h2>

<h3>Take the Control Back!</h3>
<p>
    Whether training or just typing normally, I try to make a point of <b>deleting the whole word</b> if I make a mistake.
</p><p>
    This is sometimes faster, more precise and more comfortable than mashing the Back key, but more importantly it lets you type the word correctly before proceeding. That may help in the long run: When practising a music instrument for instance, I focus on doing it right so I don't ingrain any mistakes into my muscle memory and so I can learn in flow. I believe that typing is similar in this respect.
</p><p>
    Extend helps me do this quite easily (<b>Ext+T+O</b> for <b>Ctrl+Back</b>).
</p>


<h3>Get comfy!</h3>
<p>
    You may have started using the Colemak layout because you heard that it's more ergonomic and comfortable? Congratulations on that choice then. But there are many other factors to consider and they don't only affect your wellbeing but your health and probably even your typing speed! So don't ignore ergonomics but learn and implement things that are good for you in all aspects of life, your typing included.
</p><p>
    I will simply hand the mic over to Xayvier alias Viper, who quit speedtyping shortly after becoming the world's fastest Colemak typist because of bad hand pains, but is back now and still blindingly fast. Do check out <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2671-vipers-ergonomics-guide/#p23699">Viper's Ergonomics Guide</a></b>! As we like to say about Colemak itself: <b><i>Your hands will thank you!</i></b>
</p>


<h3>Alternate fingerings</h3>
<p>
    Alt-fingering means not using the default finger allocation for a key. It can be a weird habit, but it can also be a useful tool to avoid same-finger and other bad bigrams: Instead of hitting two following keys with the same finger which is stressful, you use different fingers even though both keys "belong to" the same finger.
</p><p>
    At some point in learning a layout, you'll start to notice some bigrams being less than optimal. One of the selling points for Colemak is that it allows you to use standard touch typing technique without having to devise a lot of "homebrew" alt-fingering tricks to get fast. The fastest QWERTY typists typically use a whole lot of alt-fingering. However, any layout may at some point benefit from a little alt-fingering.
</p><p>
    Some of the <a href="http://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html">same-finger bigrams on the Colemak layout</a> aren't all that uncommon, even though it's been designed to have a low SFB frequency:
</p>
<code class="one-line">
  E,  KN  UE  SC  Y.
</code>
<p>
    Yes – SC/CS is a same-finger bigram on Colemak. If you've got CT/TC instead, you're using an "Angle Cheat" technique for which Colemak wasn't designed. I'd strongly advise you to use a proper Angle mod instead, since the CT/TC bigram is at least twice as common than SC/CS and so you'll spoil the excellent design of Colemak a bit by cheating.
</p><p>
    Slide your hand in so that the middle finger types N for KN/NK and MN/NM bigrams. This holds true whether you use Colemak Vanilla or DH. It's not so easy for, say, LN/NL or UE/EU so you'll still have to do those the hard way. I often find downward curling bigrams like UE and E-comma easier than the upwards ones, for some reason. I'd even alt-finger KNE in 'knew' before returning to home position, after a while it becomes second-nature.
</p><p>
    Alt-fingering is useful once you reach a certain level of dedication and skill. I wouldn't quite recommend it while starting up with a new layout, as it may confuse the newcomer trying to build muscle memory for the simple things. Gaining at least 50 WPM before starting with alt-fingering has been recommended. But several speed typists use it to good effect. I usually alt-finger KN/NK, LK/KL, MN/NM, TG/GT, BG/GB and TV/VT now (on Colemak-DH), by sliding in with the middle finger as described above. These all come naturally after a while due to their symmetry, but it's only <b>KN/NK</b> and probably LK/KL that are so common as to really need it.

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="amphetype">TRAINING WITH AMPHETYPE</h2>

<p>
    <b><a href="https://gitlab.com/franksh/amphetype">Amphetype</a></b> is a brilliant cross-platform typing trainer program written by Frank S. Hestvik, that has recently had a "revival release" with a platform update and some extra features. It'll be exiting to see its further development!
</p><p>
    Amphetype can be used for leisurely typing texts or for intensive focused training sessions, as you like. It's flexible and informative despite being a one-man project – and it's free. I keep its database in my Dropbox so I can use it from anywhere while keeping track of my texts and progress.
</p><p>
    There's an older version that I still use:
</p>
<div class="spoiler">
    <p><span>Old Amphetype:</span></p>
    <div class="spoilerBody">
        <p>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/webiest/amphetype">The original Amphetype progam</a></b> was released on GitHub and Google Code by Frank S. Hestvik who went by the username <b>Tristesse</b>.
        </p><p>
            This Amphetype version hasn't been developed since 2009, but it works without any problems and many people use it to this day. For Windows and Mac users though, running the old Python code may be problematic.
        </p><p>
            You can find a pre-compiled Windows .exe as well as an OSX build at <b><a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/downloads">Google Code Archive</a></b>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>I like using a largish font (Cambria Italic 22) and subtle colors that don't annoy the hell out of me:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
    <p><span>My Amphetype color scheme:</span></p>
    <div class="spoilerBody">
        <pre><code>
• Correct   text – #000000 (RGB   0,  0,  0)
• Correct   back – #eeeeee (RGB 238,238,238)
• Incorrect text – #660000 (RGB 102,  0,  0)
• Incorrect back – #aaaaaa (RGB 170,170,170)
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    When opening Amphetype in Windows, I usually press Alt+Space then X to maximize its window – or if you wish, use the mouse like a big muggle.

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="typeRead">TYPE-READING</h2>
<p>
    I usually get a book as a text file from <b><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></b> or similar, and put it into Amphetype. Experiment a little with how large text chunks you want to use (I like between 300 and 900 characters). This is brilliant for getting a lot of typing mileage. I've "read" Machiavelli that way, as well as Alice Through The Looking Glass, some Lovecraft and a 19th century lewd English book! ;-)
</p><p>
    For racking up mileage by type-reading books, I recommend not using too strict parameters so you won't have to type the same page again very often. Your average speed -10 WPM and 97% accuracy is a good starting point. You set the limits on the Sources tab, while selecting what text/lesson to type next. I turn off the need to press SPACE before each lesson, so I can type fluently. The timer doesn't start until you start typing a page, so take your time before diving in if you want to.
</p><p>
    Further inspiration: Maybe you want to learn lyrics or poems by heart? Of course, type-reading isn't the optimal way of enjoying poetry but can be a hard-hitting combo if you want to repeat a verse many times anyway! Maybe Kipling's "If" will sort out both your wisdom and typing skills at the same time!? Or maybe something motivational is to your tastes? Feel free to use the song I made at the top of this post... ;-)
</p><p>
    <b>Bewäre – of «ṡpéciãł çħâràcṭērṣ»</b>: If your layout doesn't support special glyphs like accented letters, en/em dashes (–/—) and typographic quotes („” “” «» etc), make sure your text doesn't have them either. The book I'm currently typing about Greek and Roman mythology has some old-fashioned spellings like <i>Æsculap</i> and <i>Aïdes</i>. For Colemak[eD] that's no problem at all of course, but beware if you aren't used to it. Here are some ways you can ensure you have a text you can type:
</p>

<div class="spoiler">
    <p><span>Spoiler:</span></p>
    <div class="spoilerBody">
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                The UTF-8 Unicode encoded texts at Project Gutenberg may have special glyphs in them. But from "more files...", look for '####-0.txt' or just '####.txt'.
            </li><li>
                The Lalopmak Amphetype fork has an option to clean out anything non-trivial I think, but I haven't used it.
            </li><li>
                Monkeytype (see below) has an option to "Remove fancy typography". It can take a whole book it seems, but didn't fix «» nor accented letters when I tried it.
            </li><li>
                There should be several tools on the web, such as this <b><a href="https://www.alejtech.com/en/services/additional-services/online-text-transformation-tools/diacritics-removal.html">Diacritics Removal Tool</a></b>. Some tools actually remove the symbols though, and others leave letters accented.

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="focusedLessons">FOCUSED LESSONS</h2>
<p>Below is a brilliant post (with an edit or two by me) on generating Amphetype training lessons to <b>focus on hard or common words</b>. It's from a topic called <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1047-lessons-for-colemak-beginners/">Lessons For Colemak Beginners</a></b>, in which there are lots of other lessons you can use as well:</p>

            </p><p>
                Here is how to practice the 1000 most common words lesson in an effective way.
            </p><p>
                I place the 1000 words in Amphetype and use settings that will generate lines of text like this: <br>
                &nbsp; the of to the of to the of to and a in and a in and a in is it you is it <br>
                &nbsp; you is it you that he was that he was that he was
            </p><p>
                I set the program to allow me to keep practicing until I reach a certain desired accuracy and speed (see below). <br>
                When I pass this threshold I am allowed to continue to type the next 2 lines from the 1000 words. <br>
                In this way I learn the layout and practice the common words and bigrams (th,st,nt,ou,io,ea, etc) at the same time. <br>
            </p><p>
                In fact I do not type the 1000 words most of the time. What I type is the first 130 to 150 words [or whatever suits you]. <br>
                Then I start again from the beginning and increase the threshold by an extra +10 WPM.
            </p><p>
                In theory and my practice (I have tried this method with over 20 layouts) you should be able to advance every day by 6-10 WPM until 50 WPM. Once I practiced for only 2 hours every day using this method, and I was advancing 6+ WPM each day. So you do not need to spend too much time typing in the beginning when you learn a layout. You should focus on increasing your muscle memory for the common bigrams and common words, which will help you increase your speed quickly. This way will not train you for individual keys, it will train you for common bigrams and you will notice that you become much faster at typing bigrams than remembering key positions, but with the other lessons in my lessons thread you can improve on this. I usually use this method exclusively until I reach 28-30 WPM and then I start the other lengthy lessons in the lessons thread.

<p>
    The Monkeytype site has separate word lists for English (the 200 most common words), English 1k and English 10k. The smallest list is good especially to start up with but I think you need to prepare for some less common words and word parts too so maybe <b>English 1k</b> is the most balanced alternative? If you use a non-randomized list in Amphetype, you can choose whether to type out the whole list or start over after typing part of the list.

    <b><a href="https://gfruit.github.io/typing/words-filter.html">GFruit's Words Filter</a></b> is a handy tool for generating more specific lists of words to train on. You start with an English word list of your chosen size and set which hand/fingers/rows to filter out words from. You can also set the desired word lengths, what letters and n-grams to include/exclude and even what kind of alternation you want to study. The resulting filtered word list can be pasted into MonkeyType, 10FastFingers or Amphetype to start training with it.
</p>

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="DamageAssessment">DAMAGE ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>Furthermore, you can let Amphetype generate a list of your "most damaging" (or slowest, most mistyped etc.) words or trigrams, and send them to the Lesson Generator! I recommend editing out rare words before making the lessons themselves so you don't risk training words like 'Cthulhu' and 'Shub-Niggurath' a lot, but otherwise this is very useful once you've racked up some mileage in your database.</p>

<p class="italic">Amphetype's Analysis tab, where you can make and export lists of words or trigrams that cause you trouble</p>

<p>After type-reading Berens' Graeco-Roman mythology book for a while, Amphetype suggested this amusing list of words for me; I just sorted it and added punctuation:</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p class="italic bold">
        <b>Amphetype said:</b> <br>
        They that were called under & into Hera/Zeus' order, have this beautiful form from their king/wife gods – with which their being became overly beautiful.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Really, that was my list of "most damaging" words – rearranged but complete. Heh! A truly divine typing task. (Θώθ )
</p><p>
    Note that I find the implications of Amphetype's "viscosity" measure a bit complex. Tristesse feels that metronomic typing is optimal if I understand him right, and this has indeed been an ideal in classic typing schools. Typing sites like Monkeytype also report consistency as a good statistic; a high consistency corresponds to a low "viscosity" as I understand it. I think that high-alternation layouts like Dvorak promote a high pace consistency. On the other hand, we know that the best typists do speed up for familiar words and elements and brake down for the trickier ones. In the Colemak layout you can roll some word parts very fast. Ergo, the best typists in the world choose to have "bad consistency" to some extent?! Hmmm....! I still use the "most damaging" stat to select words, as it seems to be the most balanced measure.
</p><p>
    I agree with Viper that what's actually important is a good typing flow, and that implies good consistency but with some flexibility too. The golden trifecta of typing is <b>Speed, Accuracy and Flow</b>.
</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>
        <b>Viper said:</b> <br>
        I'd say anything between 85-95% consistency would probably be in the sweet spot <br>
        or would correspond to a good flow <br>
        below is likely too sloppy and above is playing music, not typing.

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="grams">BIGRAM, TRIGRAM, N-GRAM TRAINING</h2>
<p>In a forum post by <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/user/2783-misterw/"><b>misterW</b></a>, he suggests a focus on <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/19132/#p19132">common and damaging n-grams</a></b>. I quite agree with that!</p>


<div class="quote">
    <p>
        <b>misterW (lightly edited) said:</b> <br>
        Typing is all about grouping chunks of characters together and into your memory. Grab a list of the most common words and n-grams: <b>'the', 'and', 'with', 'that', 'tion', 'ing', 'for'</b>. You want to be typing those extremely fast. Roll your fingers whenever possible. You want to commit these chunks into memory. You could think of it as, "I'm going to become the best in the world at typing the word <i>different</i>."
    </p><p>
        What would you need to do to accomplish that? You need to practice it until it becomes second nature that you don't even have to think about it. Visualization helps. When away from the keyboard, visualize in your mind where the keys are and what fingers you will use to type the word "that" or whatever word you struggle with.
    </p><p>
        [...]
    </p><p>
        Don't practice full paragraphs that you struggle with. Practice small words or phrases, one at a time. So if you want to learn the <b>'tion'</b> 4-gram, just keep practicing that. Then add a leading letter: <b>'ation', 'etion', 'ition', 'otion', 'ution', 'ption'</b>, get fast and comfortable with all of those combinations. Then try full words: <b>'station', 'motion', 'fruition'</b>. You'll notice that the start of those words you haven't practiced, so you will be slow for the first few letters, and then you'll speed through the 'tion' part that you practiced. That's good.
    </p><p>
        Practice it every day. If your hands get tired, take a break and freshen your mind by trying a new combination, say <b>'ent'</b>. Then <b>'went'</b>, then <b>'enter'</b>, progressing to <b>'movement'</b>.
    </p>
</div>

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="tarmak">TARMAK LEARNING USING COLEMAK</h2>
<p><b><a href="tarmak-intro.html">Tarmak</a></b>, as you may know, is my progression of four intermediate layouts forming stepping stones to the Colemak layout by only changing 3–4 keys at a time. Many have used these Tarmak layouts to learn Colemak gradually, while others prefer to dive right in and learn Colemak cold turkey. But there is a middle ground! User <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/user/3163-colemux/"><b>colemux</b></a> devised a clever way of sorting out <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/p3/#p22779">words based on the Tarmak steps</a></b> to train on. Doing this, you can have either full Colemak or the appropriate Tarmak# layout installed while training. In a way, it's learning with Tarmak without the need for installing Tarmak!</p>

<div class="spoiler">
    <p><span>Spoiler:</span></p>
    <div class="spoilerBody">
        <div class="quote">
            <p><b>colemux said:</b><br>
                Even for those happy to stick to pure Colemak, I think Tarmak is a nice route for that too: Just take each Tarmak level in turn and pick only words that are "pure Colemak" to practice with, in the sense that they don't include any keys that are not in their Colemak positions in Tarmak# – e.g. for Tarmak4, no L, U or I.
            </p>
        </div>


        <p>
            If at some point you do wish to type some real text while keeping your Tarmak training warm, you can then use the Tarmak layout step you have trained up to as it'll have all the letters you've trained in their Colemak positions and the others in their QWERTY positions.
        </p><p>
            The new letters in the five Tarmak steps are <b>enk gtf rsd jyop lui</b>. The letters common for QWERTY and Colemak are <b>qw ah zxcvbm</b>.
        </p><p>
            Here's how to make a "pure Tarmak4 only" word list using the BASH command line in Windows or Linux:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="one-line">
grep '^[enkgtfrsdjyop]*$' google-10000-english-sfw.txt | sed -r '/^.{,2}$/d' | grep 'j\|y\|o\|p' &gt; train-tarmak4-len3-co.txt
        </code></pre>

        <p>This produced a list of 360 words...</p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                from the Google 10000 most common English words (with swear words removed) syllabus (link below),
            </li><li>
                only containing Colemak letters different from their QWERTY positions up to and including the Tarmak4 step,
            </li><li>
                of length 3 letters or longer,
            </li><li>
                each word containing at least one of the Tarmak4 letters JYOP.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the first steps, include the common-ground letters to get enough words:</p>
        <pre><code class="one-line">
grep '^[qwahzxcvbmenk]*$' google-10000-english-sfw.txt | sed -r '/^.{,1}$/d' | grep 'e\|n\|k' &gt; train-tarmak1-len2-qwco.txt
        </code></pre>
        <p>This produced 120 words...</p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                only containing letters common to QWERTY and Colemak plus the Tarmak1 letters ENK,
            </li><li>
                of length 2 or longer (giving more words but some strange 2-letter ones),
            </li><li>
                with at least one of the Tarmak1 letters ENK in them.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>


<p>
    You can find a directory of such word lists <b><a href="res/div/SpeedTraining/Colemux_TarmakTrainingLists/">here</a></b>. Paste one into Amphetype or Monkeytype to generate custom lessons.  ( のvの) c[_]

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="pangram">PANGRAM LEARNING/TRAINING</h2>
<p>
    A <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram">pangram</a></b> is a short phrase that contains all letters. Speed typist Sophie at the Colemak Discord used the best-known one about the quick brown fox to learn Colemak! She just typed it over and over until she knew where all the keys are. It's not a bad way of learning a layout I think, as you can do it anywhere without other tools than a simple text box – or in Amphetype or Monkeytype (see below) if you wish.
</p><p>
    At higher skill levels, it's probably best to switch your training to the most common words and n-grams as described above. But maybe it's beneficial for the better typists as well to drill the placement of the rarest letters as well now and then, as those may trip you up more easily.
</p><p>
    Sophie recommends using a pangram with mostly typical words. The "quick brown fox" one is a good example, as it uses the common word "the" twice and has no really weird words. Here are some fun pangram examples: 
</p>
<code class="one-line">
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
</code><code class="one-line">
    Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
</code><code class="one-line">
    Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
</code><code class="one-line">
    We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize.
</code><code class="one-line">
    How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts!
</code><code class="one-line">
    That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog. Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you again, creating chaos.
</code>
<p>
    That last one is a phonemic pangram, containing the sounds in English rather than its letters. It lacks W and Z but those are the same in QWERTY and Colemak anyway. I think it's a cute spin on the first one!  (✿◠‿◠)
</p>
<code>The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human.</code>
<p>
    This isn't a pangram but close: It's the 160-letter phrase used by <b>The Guinness World Records</b> for their <b><a href="https://www.exideas.com/ME/meetOurChamp.php">SMS speed record</a></b>. Good practice for any keyboard type.
</p><p>
    Here's an example of pangram training using Monkeytype, see below. I used the common "The quick brown fox..." phrase which comes up by default on the custom test, pressed "change" then "random" and a suitable word count. Generally though, I mostly do time tests with the English or English Expanded vocabularies.
</p>

<br><h2 class="anchor" id="monkeytype">TRAINING WITH MONKEYTYPE</h2>
<p>
    <b><a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a></b> bears special mention. It's a smooth, fairly no-nonsense online trainer with lots of possibilities and settings. You can train words from different languages, interesting quotes and custom text. You can use tags to mark different test settings such as which Tarmak step you're on or whether it's afternoon. Monkeytype makes instructive graphs showing your speeds and mistakes through each test, and has become a natural favorite of the Colemak Discord.
</p><p>
    There are several available language settings; press Esc then 'language' to see them. The standard English list consists of the ≈200 most common words which may be too little variation, so I use English 1k the most. I'd like a setting that'd give you the most frequent words more often, for instance by their rank on the frequency list, and rare words every now and then, but that's not available (yet).
</p><p>
    To make my tests more realistic, I generally use the punctuation setting which gives a quite authentic experience. For speed roles you need to pass a 60 s test, but for practicing I prefer to instead chain two 30 s tests together. When you really want to set a new speed record, you may of course practice the short English word list without punctuation.
</p>

<p>Here are some test and appearance settings I use and recommend:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
    <p><span>Recommended Monkeytype settings:</span></p>

            We also recommend the following appearance settings for a clear, easily readable experience:

        <p class="italic">Monkeytype high-contrast color scheme by Viper and DreymaR</p><br>
        
        <p>
            Other Monkeytype settings I found useful:
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li><b>Quick Tab</b> mode lets you press Tab to start a new test quickly</li>
            <li><b>Always show words history</b> and <b>indicate typos</b> lets you review what you did afterwards</li>
            <li><b>Min WPM: 60</b> or so, and <b>Accuracy: 95</b> makes it more game-like and restarts the test for you if you have a bad start.</li>
            <li><b>Timer/progress: Show</b> may be a bit redundant as you don't have much time for it? I use <b>style/color/opacity = mini/sub/0.5</b> for subtletly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To promote using Ctrl+Back to retype wrong words, Gary_Internet at the Colemak Discord uses this interesting setup:
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li><b>Expert difficulty</b> fails the test if you press Space after a wrong word. It's a little too harsh for me though.</li>
            <li><b>Confidence mode: On</b> is what I use instead. It prevents you from editing wrong words once committed.</li>
            <li><b>Highlight mode: Word</b> shows the whole word as current or wrong! You have to decide how to edit a mistake.</li>
            <li><b>Quick end</b> is necessary for the word mode to work well</li>
            <li><b>Caret style: Off</b> means you can't see where in the current word you are typing. Again, too much for me.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="left" alt="Monkeytype test settings sample" src="res/div/SpeedTraining/Monkeytype_Test-wordselect.png" />
        <p class="italic">Monkeytype using whole word selection. Do or do not.</p><br>
        <p>
            This way, you won't see where in a word you made a mistake. If you're confident you may delete just the last letter, if not delete and retype the word.
