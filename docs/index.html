<h3>DREYMAR'S BIG BAG of KEYBOARD TRICKS – THE NEW PAGES</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the new BigBag pages! The old ones are still found in the <a
        href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2315-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-main-topic/"><b>BigBag topic at
            the Colemak Forum</b></a> as before. Our diligent doozers have already moved the important bits of it here,
    but if you're missing anything it may still be found by a stroll around the Forum Colemakum.
</p>

<br>
<h3>INTRO</h3>
<p>
    My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive
    programmable board. To this end, I use the Colemak layout with several ergonomic mods and additions that I and
    others have created over the years, on different OS platforms. These "tricks" are what this Big Bag is about.
</p><p>
    If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts! You may not be sure whether your board
    or OS layout is <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO">ISO or ANSI</a>, <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710">row-staggered or ortho</a> – or
    something else. And what on earth are dead keys, ergo mods or Extend layers?! Relax and take a deep breath please,
    because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!
</p><p>
    If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the Colemak Forum and Discord. We're a right helpful
    lot! The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on the Discord and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was
    created in my honor. Be warned...!

    <b><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a></b> is a wonderful keyboard layout that I and many others use daily
    with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get
    very fast with other layouts too. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your
    fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it! ♪～╰(＊°▽°＊)╯～♪
</p><p>
    Since I started using using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the <a
        href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forum</a> and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me
    only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even
    though the Colemak-DH mod has a lot of traction these days, it's still just a minor adjustment to vanilla Colemak
    and I consider them the same basic layout at heart. If you look at the ergonomic mods described here you'll see that
    I'm somewhat flexible about geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand
    position. The layout itself stays essentially the same.
</p><p>
    And so, <i>voila</i>, here it is! Have a look inside the Big Bag and see what you'll find! ( のvの) c[_]

<h2>DREYMAR'S BIG(!) BAG OF TRICKS?!? HALP, I'M NEW HERE!</h2>
<p>
    Inside this Big Bag there's a <i>lot</i> you can do in addition to learning Colemak! Some of it doesn't even require
    Colemak. So, this is a little beginner's introduction to the wonders of layout modding: What are your main options,
    and what's good to begin with?
</p><p>
    If any of this interests you right away, click the menus or submenus to continue exploring the Big Bag!
</p>
<br>
<ul class="disc">
    <li><b><a href="tarmak-intro.html">Tarmak Learning Layouts:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                This is a set of learning layouts for learning Colemak in 2–5 smaller steps.
            </li><li>
                Tarmak allows a much smoother and less taxing transition from QWERTY, although it may take longer.
            </li><li>
                While you will lose speed at each new step, you'll regain it a lot faster because the step is small.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="layers-extend.html">Extend:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                This mod lets you navigate, edit and more without moving your hands.
            </li><li>
                It's every bit as brilliant as Colemak itself, and independent of your typing layout!
            </li><li>
                You could learn to Extend before you learn Colemak, during, or after; all platform implementations let you do that.
            </li><li>
                Please realize that while Extend is technically "just" a layer with a modifier, it's a <i>lot</i> more powerful than your typical Fn key layer!
            </li><li>
                One of its greatest strengths is the possibilities arising from chording home row modifiers with navigation/editing and other keys.
            </li><li>
                If you want even more power, on some platforms you can add Extend-tapping for nearly endless possibilities.
            </li><li>
                See the <b><a href="layers-extend.html">Extend Extra Extreme</a></b> page if you still need convincing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="ergo-mods.html#AngleWide">Angle/Wide ergo mods:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                These ergonomic mods are also basically layout independent. QWERTY-AngleWide is definitely possible.
            </li><li>
                They make your standard row-staggered keyboard more like an ergonomically designed board.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Angle</b> mod is simple, especially on an ISO keyboard: <br>Slide ZXCVB one step to the left, keep your fingering but straighten your left wrist. Comfy!
            </li><li>
                If you have an US/ANSI keyboard, you must make a tradeoff: <br>Moving the Z key back to the old B position ("Angle-Z") is the most common solution.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Wide</b> mod is quite simple on any keyboard: <br>Slide the right-hand keys one step to the right, improving hand distance and thumb/pinky reaches. Neat!
            </li><li>
                These are "hard" mods, you could even change the physical key caps to Angle/Wide positions if possible.
                <br>My partner typed QWERTY-AngleWide without trouble, without thinking about it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="ergo-mods.html#CurlDH">Colemak-DH alias the Curl(DH) ergo mod:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                A Colemak-specific mod. Moving the common D and H down makes them easier to reach with lightly curled, relaxed fingers!
            </li><li>
                Some dislike the lateral index finger stretches to the "middle trench" so much, they made new but inferior(!) layouts to change this.
            </li><li>
                As an example, the very common <b>HE</b> bigram requires such an inward stretch followed by a rapid repositioning.
            </li><li>
                Colemak-DH achieves the same as these layouts without losing any of Colemak's excellent performance stats.
            </li><li>
                There is a tweaked <a href="tarmak.html#tmk-dh">Tarmak progression for Colemak-DH</a> if you want to learn it stepwise.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="layers-colemaked.html">Colemak[eD]:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                This only affects you if you'll be using the AltGr key, as it's about the extra mapping layers on each
                key.
            </li><li>
                Vanilla Colemak has several AltGr mappings, but they seem somewhat unintuitive and not really practical
                to me.
            </li><li>
                My "<b>[edition DreymaR]</b>" mappings place useful symbols and letters quite intuitively.
            </li><li>
                Further symbols/letters are on <b><a href="layers-main.html#deadkeys">dead keys</a></b> that all reside
                on symbol keys with AltGr.
            </li><li>
                In EPKL(Win) at least, there's a huge(!) bunch of glyphs/symbols!
            </li><li>
                If you use any of my Big Bag files you'll mostly get Colemak[eD] AltGr mappings, or VK mappings without
                any shift states added.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><a href="variants.html">Locale/script layouts:</a></b>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                If you use other languages than US English, you may want certain special letters, accents and symbols
                readily available.
            </li><li>
                I've devised lots of <b>Locale Colemak</b> layers. For some languages, there may be several different
                solutions.
            </li><li>
                Also, there are several layers for non-Latin <b>scripts</b> like Greek and Kyrillic letters, with Hebrew
                and Arabic coming up.
            </li><li>
                The script variants are for the most part phonetically mapped to Colemak, with clever solutions for the
                special ones.
            </li><li>
                The different platforms don't all have the same selection available. You could try asking (nicely) if
                you're missing a variant.

<h3>HOWS</h3>
<p>
    I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for
    Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB
    "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable
    controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say!
</p><p>
    To see platform-specific implementation info, select a platform icon from the menu above or from the purple
    lines/boxes themselves. Try it on the one below!
</p>
<div class="platform-box">
</div>

<p>
    An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as
    modules:<br>
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        The Angle/Wide ergo mods are models/remaps so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak
        ones) and may be chosen per user
    </li><li>
        The Extend layers and their switch key are options that should work with nearly any existing layout
    </li><li>
        The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout layers

    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
    Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.
