title: THE BIG BAG THEORY
---

<h3>INTRO</h3>
<p>
    My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive
    programmable board. To this end, I use the Colemak layout with several ergonomic mods and additions that I and
    others have created over the years, on different OS platforms. These "tricks" are what this Big Bag is about.
</p><p>
    If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts! You may not be sure whether your board
    or OS layout is <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO">ISO or ANSI</a>, 
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710">row-staggered or ortho</a> – or
    something else. And what on earth are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key">dead keys</a>, ergo mods or Extend layers?! 
    Relax and take a deep breath please, because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!
</p><p>
    If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the Colemak Forum and Discord. We're a right helpful
    lot! The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on the Discord and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was
    created in my honor. Be warned...!

    <b><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a></b> is a wonderful keyboard layout that I and many others use daily
    with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get
    very fast with other layouts too. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your
    fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it!

    Since I started using using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the 
    <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forum</a> and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me
    only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even
    though the Colemak-DH mod has a lot of traction these days, it's still just a minor adjustment to vanilla Colemak
    and I consider them the same basic layout at heart. If you look at the ergonomic mods described here you'll see that
    I'm somewhat flexible about geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand
    position. The layout itself stays essentially the same.

    And so, <i>voila</i>, here it is! Have a look inside the Big Bag and see what you'll find!

<h2>DREYMAR'S BIG(!) BAG OF TRICKS?!? HALP, I'M NEW HERE!</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the BigBag web pages!
</p><p>
    Inside this Big Bag there's a <i>lot</i> you can do in addition to learning Colemak! Some of it doesn't even require
    Colemak. So, this is a little beginner's introduction to the wonders of layout modding: What are your main options,
    and what's good to begin with?

                Lots of the Big Bag content could benefit users of other layouts including QWERTY.

			<h3>Tarmak Or Turkey, Sir?</h3>
			<p>
				If you have the time and energy for it, it's probably faster to learn Colemak cold turkey. But not easier, I think.
			</p><p>
				Tarmak is ideal for those who can't afford a huge hit to productivity, even for a week or so. But many others have been very pleased with it too, because as mentioned it is much less taxing to learn a small step at a time than to learn everything all at once. And the one letter (J) that gets put in the wrong positions is rare in English so it won't bother you much.

                It's every bit as brilliant as Colemak itself, and independent of your typing layout!
            </li><li>
                Please note that while Extend is technically "just" a layer with a modifier, it's a <i>lot</i> more powerful than your typical Fn key layer!
            </li><li>
                One of its greatest strengths is the possibilities arising from chording home row modifiers with navigation/editing and other keys.
            </li><li>
                If you want even more power, on some platforms you can add Extend-tapping for nearly endless possibilities.

                Some dislike the lateral index finger stretches to the "middle trench" so much, they made new but inferior(!) layouts to change this.

                As an example, the very common <b>HE</b> bigram requires such an inward stretch followed by a rapid repositioning.

        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                These ergonomic mods are basically layout independent. QWERTY-AngleWide is definitely possible.
            </li><li>
                They make your standard row-staggered keyboard more like an ergonomically designed board.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Angle</b> mod is simple, especially on an ISO keyboard: <br>Slide ZXCVB one step to the left, keep your fingering but straighten your left wrist. Comfy!
            </li><li>
                If you have an US/ANSI keyboard, you must make a tradeoff: <br>Moving the Z key back to the old B position ("Angle-Z") is the most common solution.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Wide</b> mod is quite simple on any standard keyboard: <br>Slide the right-hand keys one step to the right, improving hand distance and thumb/pinky reaches. Neat!
            </li><li>
                These are "hard" geometric mods. You could even change the physical key caps to Angle/Wide positions if possible. <br>My partner typed QWERTY-AngleWide without trouble, without thinking about it.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Sym</b> mod, lastly, goes a step further than Colemak and moves the symbol keys around. <br>It's an optional addition that I feel works well, making the often-used apostrophe/quote and hyphen/underscore keys more accessible. <br>Using the Wide mod already affects symbol keys, so I do recommend optimizing it one step further to a WideSym combo.
            </li><li>
                I use all of the above mods in conjuction: Colemak with the <b>C</b>url<b>A</b>ngle<b>W</b>ide<b>Sym</b> mods makes my <b>Colemak-CAWS</b>! 💪

			<h3>Can I have a smaller bag, please?</h3>

				If you don't feel like spending energy on mod studies then just use a standard solution like vanilla Colemak out of the box! You can't go very wrong, it's an excellent choice as it is. But maybe you do want to embark on an exciting ergo-mod journey, and yet you want a map with bigger and friendlier letters...?

            <li>
                This mostly affects you if you'll be using the AltGr key (RAlt as a layer key), as it's about the extra mapping layers on each key.
            </li><li>
                Vanilla Colemak has several AltGr mappings, but they seem incomplete, unintuitive and not really practical to me.
            </li><li>
                My <b>[edition DreymaR]</b> mappings place useful symbols and letters quite intuitively.
            </li><li>
                Further symbols/letters are on <b><a href="layers-main.html#deadkeys">dead keys</a></b> that all reside 
                on symbol keys with AltGr.
            </li><li>
                EPKL for Windows has a huge bunch of glyphs/symbols in its dead key layers!<br>
                Linux DKs are generally quite well populated but not to the same extent.<br>
                For other platforms, I haven't got any rich DK solutions I'm afraid.
            </li><li>
                If you use any of my Big Bag files you'll mostly get Colemak[eD] AltGr mappings, or VK mappings without 
                any shift states added.
            </li><li>
                The [eD] mappings and dead keys can of course be used with other layouts too! But some placements may be less intuitive then.

        <p><span>"What's the best symbols/coding layer layout?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoiler-body">
			<h3>Layer it on!</h3>
			<p>
				That's bound to be fairly individual, isn't it? No one size fits all. It matters a lot which languages you use, and also whether you need emojis or technical notation the most – or maybe both?! 👀
			</p><p>
				In fact, I strongly distrust layer concepts that try to fit "all the useful" accented letters and/or symbols into one or a couple of layers! (Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EurKEY">EurKey</a> and others including parts of the default Colemak AltGr layer, I'm looking at you!) Sounds like a neat enough idea at first, but it quickly gets messy and awkward as once you've used up, say, the <kbd>I</kbd> key for the letter <code class="inline">Ïï</code> you have no intuitive position left for the letters <code class="inline">Íí Ìì Îî Ǐǐ</code> etc etc: Of the 19 dead keys in Colemak[eD], 14 or so hold different accent mappings for <code class="inline">Ii</code>. With symbols it's the same pickle as there are many types of symbols and no easy way to map all of them to a layer intuitively. Furthermore, different users don't need the same accents/symbols. So I unhumbly state that one-size-fits-most is a bad concept here.
			</p><p>
				Combining an AltGr layer with 19 different dead keys has nevertheless enabled me to provide a huge selection of glyphs at your fingertips, fairly intuitively. It means a few more key presses for the less common accents/symbols, but allows far more intuitive mappings. Once you know where the circumflex dead key is, you'll know where to find <code class="inline">Ââ Êê Îî Ôô Ûû Ŷŷ, Ĉĉ Ĥĥ Ĵĵ</code> etc. And most slashed symbols belong on the Slash dead key, etc.
			</p><p>
				For those who use accents and/or special letters in their language, I still very much recommend using one of my locale layout variants! It's so much nicer to have the special letters of your own language in more accessible positions. See below.
			</p><p>
				For coding, pretty much the same applies. But in this case, you should also look into harnessing the power of sequences (the Compose method, see below) and power strings if you're on a platform that supports them (such as Windows with the EPKL program). With those you can get not only boilerplate text but cursor movements and selection, for instance to type out a couple of HTML tags and place the cursor in between them with one mapping. Using sequences, you can have even more intuitive – albeit multi-character – triggers for your mappings. Such as <code class="inline">'addr</code> with Compose for your address.
			</p><p>
				Best of luck with finding layers and methods that help you do what you want to do, intuitively and powerfully!
			</p>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key"><b>Compose:</b></a>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
            </li><li>
                There is another awesome input method called Compose that bears mentioning!
            </li><li>
                Defining a key as a Compose key lets you input advanced stuff using sequences, such as <kbd>a</kbd> then <kbd>'</kbd> with <kbd>Compose</kbd> for á.
            </li><li>
                I didn't stop there though, and realized that pretty much anything can be made with Compose sequences.
            </li><li>
                Example: It's easier to compose the mnemonic sequence "work" than to remember to which key I mapped a string of glyphs like
                <br>&nbsp; 🕘 🏢 🕔.
            </li><li>
                The Compose method is native to Linux/XKB, and EPKL for Windows has a powerful and readily modifiable Compose method.
            </li><li>
                These days, I'm so much into using and refining different mapping triggers for different purposes. I believe in using a combination of Extend, Compose and dead keys.
            </li><li>
                For EPKL on Windows, I've even developed combo keys: The <b>MoDK</b> key is both an Extend modifier on hold and a trigger of different dead keys on tap. And the <b>CodeKey</b> is both a Compose key and, if no composable sequence is recognized, a dead key. These are very very powerful and useful together!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="spoiler-body">
			<h3>Trigger-happy yet?</h3>
			<p>
				It may seem daunting and maybe overmuch to recommend three different methods of triggering layer mappings. But each has its own merits:
			</p>
			<ul class="dashed">
				<li>
					Dead keys are a fast and unintrusive way of releasing single-output mappings that are intuitively linkable to single key/character triggers.
				</li><li>
					Extend is a powerful way of doing tasks like navigation/editing or NumPad input, where you often want to stay in a layer for multiple key strokes.
				</li><li>
					Compose is a way of mapping lots of different things onto one sequence-based "layer". The EPKL Compose table file holds 3000+ entries, some quite complex!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So you see, in my world at least there's room and need for all of those. Until recently I didn't have Compose, but I've grown to love it very much. And the combo keys even more! 😻

<h3>HOWS</h3>
<p>
    I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for
    Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB
    "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable
    controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say!
</p><p>
    To see platform-specific implementation info, select a platform icon from the menu above or from the purple
    lines/boxes themselves. Try it on the one below!
</p>
<div class="platform-box">
</div>

<p>
    An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:
</p>
<br><ul class="disc">
    <li>
        The Angle/Wide ergo mods are models/remaps so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak
        ones) and may be chosen per user
    </li><li>
        The Extend layers and their switch key are options that should work with nearly any existing layout
    </li><li>
        The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout layers

    </li>
</ul>

    Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.

            <li>
                Get the Big Bag implementations (Win/EPKL, Linux/XKB, Controllers/TMK) up and going as GitHub repositories.
            </li><li>
                Present the Big Bag more hypertextually on GitHub web pages with a colemak.org address (still
                Work-In-Progress).
            </li><li>
                Updated Rulemak and Bulmak to 2016 versions (<b>ru/by/ua, bg/rs/mk</b> – although only found in
                <b>ru</b> and <b>bg</b> so far): <br>
                East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) & South Slavic
                (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?)
            </li><li>
                Tarmak layouts for Curl-DH modders. The changes are minor, but should be easily accessible for the newcomer.
            </li><li>
                Training topic: Alternative fingering. Tricks like sliding in for the NK/KN bigram are useful for the
                somewhat advanced typist.
            </li><li>
                Transition from DHk (the 2017 standard) to DHm (SteveP's original DH mod) as the Colemak-DH standard.
            </li>

        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                Dead keys with currency on AltGr+4, Greek on AltGr+5, tech/math stuff on AltGr+= and IPA++ on AltGr+Shift+numbers(?) [done in EPKL]
            </li><li>
                A total of 4 Extend layers: Basic/nav/edit, NumPad++, Coding/etc, Hotstrings – or whatever you like! [done in EPKL]
            </li><li>
                Modifier keys for 4 Extend layers. For instance, Caps+{--, RShift, RAlt, RShift+RAlt}. Holding down Caps maintains the layer state. [done in EPKL]
            </li><li>
                Fix the

            </li><li>
                Also an Arabic phonetic Colemak variant, building on the same principles as the Hebrew one.
            </li><li>
                Develop and test a <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2389-vietnamese-colemak/">Vietnamese Colemak</a> (with <b>icedryst</b> and whoever's interested).
            </li><li>
                More locale layers: <b>epo</b> (Esperanto), …? (Any suggestions, or comments on the existing ones?)
            </li><li>
                "Tap dance sequences", using dead keys and/or combines to release strings and things without having to hold modifier chords.
            </li><li>
                Further Compose/sequencing, dual-mode key and other layer/triggering developments.

    <b>Colemak Forum</b></a>, but it's outdated by now. This site should pretty much contain all the important bits and the proverbial kitchen sink,
    but if you're missing anything old it may still be found by a stroll around the Forum Colemakum.
