title: THE BIG BAG THEORY
---

<h3 class="anchor" id="top">INTRO</h3>
<p>
    My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive programmable 
    board – or if you do! To this end, I use several ergonomic mods and tools that I and others have created over the years, 
    on different OS platforms. My many "typing tricks" are what the Big Bag is about.
</p><p>
    If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts. You may not be sure whether your board
    or OS layout is <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO">ISO or ANSI</a>, 
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710">row-staggered or ortho</a> – or
    something else. And what on earth are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key">dead keys</a>, <a href="/ergo-mods.html">ergo mods</a> or <a href="/layers-extend.html">Extend layers</a>?! 
</p><p>
    Relax and take a deep breath please, because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!

    The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on Discord, Reddit and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was created in my honor. Be warned...!

<h3 class="anchor" id="colemak">THE COLEMAK KEYBOARD LAYOUT</h3>
<p>
    <b><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a></b> is a great keyboard layout that I and many others use daily with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get very fast with other layouts too. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it!
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b￣◇￣)b
</p><p>
    Since I started using using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the Colemak Forum and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even though I add mods like Colemak-DH, better symbol key placements and geometric ergo mods like Angle/Wide, these are still just minor adjustments. The layout itself stays essentially the same.
</p><p>
    If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak Forum</a> 
    and the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rpbxP2REjZ">Colemak Discord</a> for guidance. We're a right helpful lot! 
</p><p>
    I would also advise a visit to the <a href="https://www.colemak.org/"><b>colemak.org</b></a> community site, which answers several layout-related questions. It's the "Read the FAQ" option, pretty much.
</p><p>
    There are <a href="https://bit.ly/alt-layouts-quickstart">other optimized layouts</a> that may be good for you. And there are other layouts that aren't nearly as good as they claim to be, so beware. Ask around if you're curious, but know that Colemak is a well-tried and solid choice. Either way, many of my mods and tools can be used with different layouts – even with QWERTY should you wish to (ugh!).

                There <i>is</i> a lot to choose from. Maybe as a newcomer you experience decision fatigue? 
            </li><li>
                Wouldn't it be easier if I were to tell you "this is the best option, use this!"?
            </li><li>
                But I can't really. Because people are different and have different preferences and needs. For some I'd suggest Extend and Colemak(-DH) only, 
                for others I'd suggest getting the whole BigBag experience and maybe even tweaking it to their own needs.
            </li><li>
                I hope the Big Bag can help you learn your options, give you ideas and eventually aid your choices!
            </li><li>
                I will give you one piece of well-meant advice though: Don't chase your layout choice too deeply down the rabbit hole. 
                I mean, I wouldn't want you to settle for a crap layout (I could mention a few of those!) but beyond Colemak's level or so there's 
                still so much to choose from. Personal preferences start to matter quite a lot and real benefits are often uncertain at best.
            </li><li>
                Instead of pouncing on every soup-du-jour layout out there, consider some other things you can do to improve your typing experience! 
                I'll be covering many ideas in the following. I believe strongly that there's a lot more bang for your buck in learning Extend, 
                thumb keys and/or DKs than in transitioning from Colemak(-DH) to ISRT to APT to Canary to "CannelloniMak" to ... you get the idea.

                Tarmak is ideal for those who can't afford a huge hit to productivity, even for a week or so. But many others have been very pleased with it too, because as mentioned it is much less taxing to learn a small step at a time than to learn everything all at once. And the one letter (J) that gets put in the wrong positions is rare in English so it won't bother you much.

                If you have an US/ANSI keyboard, you must make a tradeoff: <br>Moving the Z key back to the old B position ("Angle-Z") is the most common solution.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Wide</b> mod is quite simple on any standard keyboard: <br>Slide the right-hand keys one step to the right, improving hand distance and thumb/pinky reaches. Neat!
            </li><li>
                These are "hard" geometric mods. You could even change the physical key caps to Angle/Wide positions if possible. <br>My partner typed QWERTY-AngleWide without trouble, without thinking about it.
            </li><li>
                The <b>Sym</b> mod, lastly, goes a step further than Colemak and moves the symbol keys around. <br>It's an optional addition that I feel works well, making the often-used apostrophe/quote and hyphen/underscore keys more accessible. <br>Using the Wide mod already affects symbol keys, so I do recommend optimizing it one step further to a WideSym combo.
            </li><li>
                I use all of the above mods in conjuction: Colemak with the <b>C</b>url<b>A</b>ngle<b>W</b>ide<b>Sym</b> mods makes my <b>Colemak-CAWS</b>! 💪

            <p>
                If you don't feel like spending energy on mod studies then just use a standard solution like vanilla Colemak out of the box! You can't go very wrong, it's an excellent choice as it is. But maybe you do want to embark on an exciting ergo-mod journey, and yet you want a map with bigger and friendlier letters...?
            </p><p>

        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                This mostly affects you if you'll be using the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> key (<kbd>RAlt</kbd> as a layer key), as it's about the extra mapping layers on each key.
            </li><li>
                Vanilla Colemak has several AltGr mappings, but they seem incomplete, unintuitive and not really practical to me.
            </li><li>
                My <b>[edition DreymaR]</b> mappings place useful symbols and letters quite intuitively.
            </li><li>
                Further symbols/letters are on <b><a href="/layers-main.html#deadkeys">dead keys</a></b> that all reside 
                on symbol keys with AltGr.
            </li><li>
                EPKL for Windows has a huge bunch of glyphs/symbols in its dead key layers!<br>
                Linux DKs are generally quite well populated but not to the same extent.<br>
                For other platforms, I haven't got any rich DK solutions I'm afraid.
            </li><li>
                If you use any of my Big Bag files you'll mostly get Colemak[eD] AltGr mappings, or VK mappings without 
                any shift states added.
            </li><li>
                The [eD] mappings and dead keys can of course be used with other layouts too! But some placements may be less intuitive then.

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"What's the best symbols/coding layer layout?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoiler-body">
            <h3>Layer it on!</h3>
            <p>
                That's bound to be fairly individual, isn't it? No one size fits all. It matters a lot which languages you use, and also whether you need emojis or technical notation the most – or maybe both?! 👀
            </p><p>
                I strongly distrust layer concepts that try to fit "all the useful" accented letters and/or symbols into one or a couple of layers! (Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EurKEY">EurKey</a> and others – including parts of the default Colemak AltGr layer – I'm looking at you!) Sounds like a neat enough idea at first, but it quickly gets messy and awkward as once you've used up, say, the <kbd>I</kbd> key for the letter <code class="inline">Ïï</code> you have no intuitive position left for the letters <code class="inline">Íí Ìì Îî Ǐǐ</code> etc etc: Of the 19 dead keys in Colemak[eD], 14 or so hold different accent mappings for <code class="inline">Ii</code>. With symbols it's the same pickle as there are many types of symbols and no easy way to map all of them to a layer intuitively. Furthermore, different users don't need the same accents/symbols. So I unhumbly state that one-size-fits-most is a bad concept for symbol layers.
            </p><p>
                Combining an AltGr layer with 19 different dead keys has nevertheless enabled me to provide a huge selection of glyphs at your fingertips, fairly intuitively. It means a few more key presses for the less common accents/symbols, but allows far more intuitive mappings. Once you know where the circumflex dead key is, you'll know where to find <code class="inline">Ââ Êê Îî Ôô Ûû Ŷŷ, Ĉĉ Ĥĥ Ĵĵ</code>. Most slashed symbols belong on the Slash dead key, etc.
            </p><p>
                For those who use accents and/or special letters in their native language, I still very much recommend using one of my locale layout variants! It's so much nicer to have the special letters of your own language in more accessible positions. See below.
            </p><p>
                For coding, pretty much the same applies. But in this case, you should also look into harnessing the power of sequences (the Compose method, see below) and power strings if you're on a platform that supports them (such as Windows with the EPKL program). With those you can get not only boilerplate text but cursor movements and selection, for instance to type out a couple of HTML tags and place the cursor in between them with one mapping. Using sequences, you can have even more intuitive – albeit multi-character – triggers for your mappings. Such as <code class="inline">'addr</code> with Compose for your address.
            </p><p>
                Best of luck with finding layers and methods that help you do what you want to do, intuitively and powerfully!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div><br>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key"><b>Compose:</b></a>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
            </li><li>
                The awesome input method called Compose bears mentioning! Some may know it already from Linux.
            </li><li>
                Defining a key as a Compose key lets you input advanced stuff using sequences, such as <kbd>a</kbd> then <kbd>'</kbd> with <kbd>Compose</kbd> for á.
            </li><li>
                I didn't stop there though, realizing that pretty much anything can be made with Compose sequences.
            </li><li>
                Example: It's easier to compose the mnemonic sequence "work" than to remember to which key I mapped a string of glyphs like
                <br>&nbsp; 🕘 🏢 🕔.
            </li><li>
                The Compose method is native to Linux/XKB, and EPKL for Windows has a powerful and readily modifiable Compose method.
            </li><li>
                These days, I'm so much into using and refining different mapping triggers for different purposes. I believe in using a combination of Extend, Compose and dead keys.
            </li><li>
                For EPKL on Windows, I've even developed combo keys: The <b>MoDK</b> key is both an Extend modifier on hold and a trigger of different dead keys on tap. And the <b>CodeKey</b> is both a Compose key and, if no composable sequence is recognized, a dead key. These are very very powerful and useful together!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Are you serious, man?! Dead keys, Extend <i>and</i> Compose?!"</span></p>
        <div class="spoiler-body">
            <h3>Trigger-happy yet?</h3>
            <p>
                It may seem daunting and maybe overmuch to recommend three different methods of triggering layer mappings. But each has its own merits:
            </p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li>
                    Dead keys are a fast and unintrusive way of releasing single-output mappings that are intuitively linkable to single key/character triggers.
                </li><li>
                    Extend is a powerful way of doing tasks like navigation/editing or NumPad input, where you often want to stay in a layer for multiple key strokes.
                </li><li>
                    Compose is a way of mapping lots of different things onto one sequence-based "layer". The EPKL Compose table file holds 3000+ entries, some quite complex!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So you see, in my world at least there's room and need for all of those. Until recently I didn't have Compose, but I've grown to love it very much. And the combo keys even more! 😻

            <li>
                If you use other languages than US English, you may want certain special letters, accents and symbols
                readily available.
            </li><li>
                I've devised lots of <b>Locale Colemak</b> layers. For some languages, there may be several different solutions.
            </li><li>
                Also, there are several layers for non-Latin <b>scripts</b> like Greek and Kyrillic letters, with Hebrew
                and Arabic coming up.
            </li><li>
                The script variants are for the most part phonetically mapped to Colemak, with clever solutions for the
                special ones.
            </li><li>
                The different platforms don't all have the same selection available. You could try asking (nicely) if
                you're missing a variant.

            <h3>Cross-talk?</h3>
            <p>
                No, Colemak isn't optimized for other languages than English <i>per se</i>. For many languages that still works surprisingly well, 
                but some letters may not be optimally placed. Some non-English users have noticed a few kinks.
            </p><p>
                There exist attempts to make layouts that are better for a combination of languages. One problem is that no two users are alike.
            </p><p>
                Do keep in mind that you may be using more English than you think about. For one, you're reading this in English … written by a Norwegian.
            </p><p>
                The purpose and nature of my locale/script variants is to enable a Colemak user to type the special letters of different languages.
                These special letters should be as accessible as their frequency in that language dictates.
            </p><p>
                The Big Bag locale variants mostly use the bracket and ISO key; they may therefore be portable to many other layouts that don't affect these keys.

            <p>
                Compared to the average typist (40 WPM) I am fast. Compared to most typists on Monkeytype and the Colemak Discord (100–200 WPM it seems), I'm not. 
                Even though I've used Colemak since 2007, I never became faster than 60–80 WPM with it on a typical one-minute test, depending on text complexity.
                That doesn't matter much to me though, I'm not about the competition but about making typing good and comfortable and powerful.
            </p><p>
                I do know how to listen though. The advice you'll find on the Big Bag Training page comes from and is approved by some of the fastest typists. 
                In all my years of using Colemak I've talked with and listened to what people say, so I think you can trust my advice.
            </p><p>
                I also do believe that many of the Big Bag tricks can help your typing speed in addition to your comfort. Consider learning to use such tools as 
                Sticky Shift, Repeat and CoDeKey while typing, as they can save you same-finger bigrams, awkward moments and even a few key presses.

<ul class="disc">
    <li>
        <b>Windows</b>: I use several tools including MSKCL and SharpKeys, but even these come bundled with my EPKL program repo. 
        EPKL is a powerful portable keyboard layout program that contains the whole Big Bag experience – and more.

        <b>Linux</b>: There's a BigBag for XKB repo, with my modifications to the X.Org xkb-data files.
    </li><li>
        <b>Controllers</b>: I implemented much of my tricks in TMK for a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter; 
        they should work for most programmable controllers.
    </li><li>
        <b>Mac</b>: I haven't done anything for Apple myself, but others have made partial Big Bag implementations.

<div class="platform-box" id="pfbx-Index"></div><!-- Index platform box -->

<p>One advantage with my Big Bag implementations is that you can use most of the enhancements modularly:</p>
<br><ul class="disc">
    <li>
        The Angle/Wide/Sym ergo mods should work with nearly any layout you choose – even QWERTY
    </li><li>
        Extend/Compose/DKs/etc should work with nearly any existing layout
    </li><li>
        Locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout layers
    </li>
</ul><br>
<p>Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal for me, as it is in the world of Linux.</p>
