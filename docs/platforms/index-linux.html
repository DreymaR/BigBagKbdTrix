        I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. You can check out the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438"><b>Big Bag (XKB) forum topic</b></a> for more detailed info.

        If you just want to skip to the download (at your own risk), here is the <b><a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixXKB">Github Big Bag for XKB repository</a></b>. It's got a little documentation and you can run its scripts with a <b>-h</b> tag for help but the main info is still in that Forum topic.
