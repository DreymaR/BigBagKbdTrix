    <br><h4>Linux/XKB Platform Info</h4>
    <p>
        Most of the BigBag is implemented for Linux in the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixXKB"><b>Big Bag for XKB</b></a> repository on GitHub.
    </p><p>
        Briefly, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org <a href="https://github.com/freedesktop/xkeyboard-config">xkeyboard-config files</a> found in the xkb-data package, that define keyboard layout related settings for the X server:
    </p>
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>
			Colemak[eD] and several locale/script variants as layout definitions; Unified Symbols (US) and Keep Local Symbols (KS) flavors of these
		</li><li>
			The Tarmak transitional layouts and Mirrored Colemak, likewise defined as layouts (found under the US locale)
		</li><li>
			Extend, implemented as lvl5–8 layout mappings together with a lvl5 modifier key that can be added to the CapsLock key using an option setting
		</li><li>
			Ergonomic mods mostly implemented as keyboard "models", so they may be applied to any layout – not just Colemak!
		</li><li>
			Some "soft" ergo mods implemented as xkb options instead; this is the case for the Curl-DH and Sym mods
		</li><li>
			There's an install BASH script that writes my modifications to the X11 xkb directory so you may choose them in settings or by commands
		</li><li>
			There's a setkb.sh script that can generate a setxkbmap command to activate one of the BigBag layout combos
		</li>
	</ul>
    <p>
        You can check out the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438"><b>Big Bag (XKB) forum topic</b></a> for more detailed info. It's a bit messy and outdated here and there, but Linux users are often clever and adventurous so I hope you manage.
    </p><p>
        If you just want to skip to the download (at your own risk), here is the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixXKB"><b>Big Bag for XKB repository</b></a>. It's got a little documentation and you can run its scripts with a <b>-h</b> tag for help but the main info is still here and in that Forum topic.

    <h4>Notes:</h4>
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>
			The setkb script can help you activate a BigBag layout. It is not made for activating other layout setups, such as your current default.
		</li><li>
			To see what your current setup is, you can for instance run the command 'setxkbmap -v 9' (or whatever verbosity level suits you).
		</li><li>
			To get Colemak-DH right, you have to both use the 'misc:cmk_curl_dh' option itself, and an Angle keyboard model if you're on a rowstag keyboard.
		</li>
	</ul>
