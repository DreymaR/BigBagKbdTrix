    I've implemented my Big Bag for Windows using Farkas Máté's Portable Keyboard Layout app. In my <b><a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL">Github EPKL repository</a></b> you'll find not only the Big Bag tricks but a whole new version of PKL called <b>EPKL</b> where the E is a bit mystical but it can stand for <b>"EPiKaL"</b> (my version used to be called <b>PKL[eD]</b> meaning "PKL, edition DreymaR"). It adds to the already good functionality of PKL in many ways. See the Downloads section below.

    In EPKL, each layout variant (a combo of layout type, keyboard type, ergo mods and locale specific mappings) from plain Colemak to your favourite locale variant of Colemak-CAW[eD](!) uses its own folder with at least a layout.ini file in it and usually at least some state images for the on-screen help image. In the old PKL all dead key and Extend images and whatnot would be there too, but these may also be elsewhere now.
</p>

<p>
    In the main EPKL layout settings .ini file you can select one or more of those folders as your active layout(s) – if you wish, by setting shortcut switches for model/ergo/locale variants. The [eD] layouts contain full AltGr mappings and dead keys. If you have simpler needs and don't wish to use the Right Alt key to produce all these wonderful symbols, there are also VirtualKey (VK) layouts that only move keys around without adding anything to them.
</p>

<p>
    EPKL has separate help images for each shift state and dead key (which is quite a lot of images as there are 19 different dead keys!) as well as for Extend, that activate when you need them. You can set your own hotkey to show/hide these, or use the default Ctrl+Shift+1. The help image will jump around your screen if you mouse over it, trying to stay out of the way.

<p>
    Due to the non-modular nature of EPKL and the plethora of possibilities, not all locale/ergo combinations are premade. EPKL makes it easier than it used to be though! There's a tutorial in the repository README.

    PKL[eD] was tested by <b><a href="https://10fastfingers.com/user/1429229">Viper</a></b> who is <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2449-it-is-a-great-day-for-colemak/">likely the world's fastest Colemak typist these days</a>, and according to him it works without trouble at typing speeds of at least 150 WPM, probably 200+ WPM!
