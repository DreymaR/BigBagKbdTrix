    <br><h4>Windows Platform Info</h4>

        Extend is implemented for Windows in the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL"><b>Big Bag for EPKL</b></a> repository on GitHub.
    </p><p>
        I've implemented my Big Bag for Windows using my fork of Farkas Máté's Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) app. 
        In the Github EPKL repository you'll find not only the Big Bag of tricks itself, but <b>EPKL</b> – a whole new version of the now abandonware PKL. 
        The E in EPKL is a bit mystical but it can stand for <b>"EPiKaL"</b>. 
        EPKL adds to the already useful functionality of PKL in a lot of ways. It's come a long way from its predecessor.
    </p><p>
        In EPKL, each layout variant (a combo of layout type, keyboard type, ergo mods and locale specific mappings) from plain Colemak to your favourite locale variant of Colemak-eD-CAWS(!) uses its own folder with at least a layout.ini file in it and usually at least some state images for the on-screen help image. In the old PKL all dead key and Extend images and whatnot would be there too, but these are generally kept elsewhere now.
    </p><p>
        In the EPKL layout settings files you can select one or more of those folders as your active layout(s). The [eD] layouts contain full AltGr mappings and dead keys. If you have simpler needs and don't wish to use the Right Alt key to produce all these wonderful symbols, there are also VirtualKey (VK) layouts that only move keys around without adding anything to them.
    </p><p>
        EPKL has separate help images for each shift state and dead key (which is quite a lot of images as there are 19 different dead keys!) as well as for Extend, that activate when you need them. The state images can be hidden by default if you wish. You can set your own hotkey to show/hide the images, or use the default Ctrl+Shift+1. The help image will jump around your screen if you mouse over it, trying to stay out of the way.
    </p><p>
        Due to the plethora of possibilities, not all locale/ergo combinations are premade. EPKL makes it easier than it used to be though! There's a tutorial in the repository READMEs.
    </p><p>
        EPKL was tested by <b><a href="https://10fastfingers.com/user/1429229">Viper</a></b> who is <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2449-it-is-a-great-day-for-colemak/">likely the world's fastest Colemak typist these days</a>, and according to him it works without trouble at typing speeds of at least 150 WPM, probably 200+ WPM! A little pace smoothing will occur at high enough speeds.
