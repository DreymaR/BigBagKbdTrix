    <br><h4>Windows Extend Info</h4>
    <p>
        Extend is implemented for Windows in the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL"><b>Big Bag for (E)PKL</b></a> repository on GitHub. 
        See the <a href="/index.html#platform-info">Platforms section</a> on the index page and links therein for more info.
    </p><p>
        I know of no good way to implement Extend for an installable (MSKLC) layout for Windows. 
        My EPKL program, on the other hand, has the best Extend implementation available that I know of.
    </p><p>
        EPKL specific Extend info and settings are found on the <a href="/layers-main.html#extend">main Layers page</a>.
