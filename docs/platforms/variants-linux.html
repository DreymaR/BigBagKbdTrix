            You can select any layout from the normal layout chooser – enter your language in the search field to narrow it down. There are two types:
        </li><li>
            "Unified symbols" <b>(cmk_ed_us)</b> layouts, using the US-like symbol mappings that I recommend; these give the full Colemak[eD] experience
        </li><li>
            "Keep local symbols" <b>(cmk_ed_ks)</b> layouts, if you don't want to change the symbol mappings from your locale but just the letter keys (and semicolon)
        </li><li>
            Using command line or default file, the Cmk[eD] layouts are called 'lc:cmk_ed_us' and 'lc:cmk_ed_ks', where 'lc' is the locale code ('se' for Swedish for instance)
        </li>
    </ul>

            You can select any layout from the normal layout chooser – enter your language in the search field to narrow it down.

            The non-latin script layers are called "<b>&lt;Language&gt; (Colemak, phonetic)</b>"
        </li><li>
            Using command line or default file, the phonetic layouts are called 'ru:colemak', 'bg:colemak', 'gr:colemak' and 'il:colemak'

<!-- Mirrored Colemak -->
<div class="platform-content" id="pfct-MirroredColemak">
    <p>
        On XKB: Using a Group setup, add the mirrored Colemak[eD] as your next layout group. <br>
             Then you may choose between a slew of "key(s) to change layout (while pressed)" options! <br>
             This does compromise your group options a bit (if you need to use non-latin layouts etc). <br>
             If that bothers you, consider using both 'next' and 'last' layout groups with chooser keys. <br>
             Use Ubuntu: 'Keyboard Layout'->'Options'->'key(s) to change layout (while pressed)'.

            This is only for English(US) – if you want something else you'll have to edit it in yourself.
        </li><li>
            You can choose it in the normal language chooser; it's called "<b>English (Colemak[eD], mirrored)</b>"
        </li><li>
            Using command line or default file, the layout is called '<b>us:cmk_ed_mirror</b>'
        </li><li>
            AngleWide is chosen separately, as a keyboard model. See the <a href="ergo-mods.html#angle-wide">Ergonomy page</a>.
