        There is an implementation of the Big Bag <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/extend-karabiner"><b>Extend layer for Karabinier Elements</b></a> by CSGO from the Colemak Discord (also known as Amogus or Professor X-Wing). 
        He has also made <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/karabiner-colemak"><b>a script to generate different Big Bag variant combos</b></a>. Have a look!
    </p><br><p>
        <b>Mattmc3</b> made a <a href="https://github.com/mattmc3/keyboard-tools/tree/master/Karabiner">Karabinier-Elements config generator</a> for his keyboard tools in 2019. It looks cool, but I haven't tried it out myself.
    </p><p>
        <b>Zhang0313</b>, similarly, made a <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2512-karabiner-json-for-extend-layer-for-macos-sierra/">Karabinier .json for Extend</a> in 2019, that should be compatible with MacOS Sierra.
    </p><p>
        <b>Mkborregaard</b> on the Colemak Forums implemented some of the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020">Big Bag (Mac) for Karabinier</a> back in 2015, but I'm told this tool <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/18673/#p18673">doesn't work for MacOS Sierra</a> onwards?
    </p><p>
        I don't know if or how the above are different from ProfXWing's implementation. All in all, I'd recommend checking that one out first, as its maker is still active at the Colemak Discord (under the name CSGO or something like that).
