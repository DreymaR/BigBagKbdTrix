    <p>
        There is an implementation of the Big Bag <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/extend-karabiner"><b>Extend layer for Karabinier Elements</b></a> by CSGO from the Colemak Discord (also known as Amogus or Professor X-Wing). 
        He's made a script to generate different variants. Have a look!
