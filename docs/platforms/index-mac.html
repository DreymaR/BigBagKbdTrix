        There is an implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/karabiner-colemak"><b>Big Bag for Karabinier Elements</b></a> by CSGO from the Colemak Discord (also known as Amogus or Professor X-Wing). He's made a script to generate different variants. There's also a repo for just the <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/extend-karabiner"><b>Extend layer</b> if that's what you want. This is very promising for the Mac crowd!
    </p><p>
        I hear good things about the <a href="https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad">KMonad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata">Kanata</a> key remapping tools; these seem able to implement key mapping layers and Extend well across platforms. Maybe I'll get around to trying them out.
    </p><p>
        There is also an older implementation that I know of: Colemak Forum user <b>mkborregaard</b> implemented some of the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020"><b>Big Bag (Mac) for Karabinier</b></a> <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/18673/#p18673">(not maintained by me)</a>, but I'm told this tool doesn't work for MacOS Sierra onwards?
    </p><p>
        If anyone has good news about Apple compatible implementations of the BigBag or similar tricks, please let me know.
