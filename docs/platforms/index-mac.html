        Sadly, there isn't a lot of content for the Apple user here. Colemak Forum user <b>mkborregaard</b> implemented some of the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020"><b>Big Bag (Mac) for Karabinier</b></a> <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/18673/#p18673">(not maintained by me)</a>, but this tool doesn't work well anymore.

        There is a newer implementation of the Big Bag <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/extend-karabiner"><b>Extend layer for Karabinier Elements</b></a> by CSGO from the Colemak Discord (also known as Amogus or Professor X-Wing). He's made a script to generate different variants. This looks very promising for the Mac crowd!

        I hear good things about the <a href="https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad">KMonad Keyboard Management Tool</a>, and it seems able to implement layers and Extend well across platforms. Maybe I'll get around to trying it out. For now, if anyone has good news about Apple platform implementations of the BigBag or similar tricks, please let me know.
