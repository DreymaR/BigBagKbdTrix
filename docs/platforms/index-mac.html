        There is an implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/karabiner-colemak"><b>Big Bag for Karabinier Elements</b></a> by CSGO from the Colemak Discord (also known as Amogus or Professor X-Wing). He's made a script to generate different variants. There's also a repo for just the <a href="https://github.com/ProfXwing/extend-karabiner"><b>Extend layer</b></a> if that's what you want. This is very promising for the Mac crowd!
    </p><p>
        I hear good things about the <a href="https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad">KMonad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata">Kanata</a> key remapping tools. These seem able to implement key mapping layers including Extend well across platforms; maybe I'll get around to trying them out. Key mapping tends to be quite robust and reliable, but less good at mapping to any glyphs that the OS layout doesn't contain. A key mapping tool must work in concert with the underlying system layout.

        If anyone has good news about Apple compatible implementations of the BigBag or similar tricks, please let me know.
