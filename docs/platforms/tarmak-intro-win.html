        See below for a download of all four steps plus "Tarmak0" (a.k.a. QWERTY) and "Tarmak5" (a.k.a. Colemak).

        These transitional layouts were implemented as VirtualKey ones, so any AltGr and dead key mappings you'll get will be the same as on your installed keyboard layout in Windows. The layouts should support Extend mode fully. If you define several of them in your EPKL settings file, you can swiftly change between them should you wish to.
    </p><p>
        My EPKL settings file comes with lines prepared for Tarmak progressions that you may simply uncomment (commenting out whatever else 'layout =' lines are active there) and start using. You may choose between a progression to vanilla Colemak or to Colemak-DH (see above). Wide mods are not (yet) available for Tarmak, but they may not be that necessary as you can always go Wide after you've reached the goal.

        There's a help image for each step, that you can see or hide with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+1 (configurable in pkl.ini). Holding Shift will show the current and previous steps in different spectral colors.
