        See below for a download of all four steps plus "Tarmak0" (a.k.a. QWERTY) and "Tarmak5" (a.k.a. Colemak).
    </p><p>
        These transitional layouts were implemented as VirtualKey ones, so any AltGr and dead key mappings you'll get will be the same as on your installed keyboard layout in Windows. The layouts should support Extend mode fully. If you define several of them in your EPKL settings file, you can swiftly change between them should you wish to.
    </p><p>
        My EPKL settings file comes with lines prepared for Tarmak progressions that you may simply uncomment (commenting out whatever else 'layout =' lines are active there) and start using. You may choose between a progression to vanilla Colemak or to Colemak-DH (see above). Wide mods are not (yet) available for Tarmak, but they may not be that necessary as you can always go Wide after you've reached the goal.
    </p><p>
        There's a help image for each step, that you can see or hide with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+1 (configurable in pkl.ini). Holding Shift will show the current and previous steps in different spectral colors.

			See the <b><a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL">EPiKaL PortableKeyboardLayout</a></b> repo at GitHub as described in the Windows platform boxes of these pages. It runs portably without much fuss. There are layouts for ISO and ANSI(US) keyboards, vanilla or Colemak-DH, and more.
		</li>    <li>
			Tarmak steps come with EPKL and can be selected quite easily. In the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/blob/master/EPKL_Layouts_Default.ini">EPKL_Layouts</a> file there are some commented-out layout lines like this one:
			<pre><code>
				;layout = Tarmak\Tmk-VK-Tm1_@K:Tarmak1,Tarmak\Tmk-VK-Tm0_@K:QWERTY
			</code></pre>
		</li>    <li>
			Remove the semicolon from that line (and ideally add one to the uncommented layout line below) then refresh EPKL and you should have Tarmak. You can use one line that cycles through the Tarmak steps on layout switch by menu or hotkey (default Ctrl+Shift+2), or like the one I quoted here that only switches between a Tarmak step and QWERTY. You could easily edit the number 1 in that line to 2, 3, 4 or 5 â€“ which is Colemak but in the same style as the Tarmak steps.
		</li>    <li>
			Another and maybe easier way would be to activate just one step at a time, with the EPKL <b>Layouts/Settings</b> dialog.
