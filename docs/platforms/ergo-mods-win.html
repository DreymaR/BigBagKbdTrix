        With the advent of modular remaps for EPKL, ergonomic mods can be selected quite easily in the settings file if they are premade.
    </p>    <p>
        Most locale variants are only premade for the CurlAngleWide ergo combination for ISO keyboards. I'm sorry, but making files and images for every possible setup will be too much work for me! So please try to tweak one yourself using a copy of an existing layout folder, or ask me for help. For help images, see if you can't wrap your head around some of the provided images even if they may not be exactly the same setup as your keyboard, or follow the somewhat techy instructions and generate your own – which you may then share with me if they're of interest to others!

        The Sym mod is implemented for several layout variants, notably the fully ergo modded Colemak-CAWS. There are a few possibilities, see the EPKL files and docs.

        EPKL supports Sticky or One-Shot modifiers. You can specify one or more keys as sticky and they'll still work as modifiers a little while after you release them. So you can tap, e.g., a Shift key and then a letter to produce a capital letter instead of having to hold down the Shift key. Many fast typists like this.
    </p>    <p>
        If you're fast enough you can even chain these OSMs, for instance tapping RCtrl, RShift and LeftArrow in rapid sequence to select the last word. But for that I'd prefer using Extend+S+T+O.
    </p>    <p>
        Otherwise, EPKL can be finicky about modifier mapping. All keys that are intended to work as OSMs or Extend release keys must be mapped in some way – such as setting them to 'Modifier' or 'VirtualKey' if you don't want to map them further. But doing this with LCtrl and/or RAlt seems to mess with the AltGr functionality if you're using that. Also, the LAlt key often causes trouble in some apps if mapped. Carefully test the mappings you want.
