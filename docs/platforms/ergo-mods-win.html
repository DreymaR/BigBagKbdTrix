        Since the advent of modular remaps for EPKL, ergonomic mods can be selected quite easily in the settings as long as they are premade.
    </p><p>
        Most locale layers are only premade for the CurlAngleWide(Sym) ergo combination for ISO keyboards. I'm sorry, but making files and images for every possible setup will be too much work for me! So please try to tweak one yourself using a copy of an existing layout folder, or ask me for help. For help images, see if you can't wrap your head around some of the provided images even if they may not be exactly the same setup as your keyboard, or follow the somewhat techy instructions and generate your own – which you may then share with me if they're of interest to others!

        The Curl mod is included in several EPKL layout combos, notably the fully ergo-modded Colemak-CAWS.

        There are a few possibilities for tweaking, see the EPKL files (e.g., the Remap file) and docs.
    </p><p>
        Another option is the MSKLC layout install found in the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL/tree/master/Other/MSKLC">EPKL Other\MSKLC folder</a>. 
        This provides a system installable Colemak[eD]-CAWS layout which may be used instead of or in addition to EPKL.

        Generally speaking, the EPKL program is the best implementation of the Big Bag. It doesn't only give you layouts, Colemak[eD] layers, Extend and ergo mods, but also powerful special keys like tap-or-hold Extend (MoDK), CoDeKey (Compose-or-Deadkey) and Repeat.
    </p><p>
        Also, entries are plentiful and readily editable so you can customize your experience.
    </p><p>
        EPKL supports Sticky or One-Shot modifiers. You can specify one or more keys as sticky and they'll still work as modifiers a little while after you release them. So you can tap, e.g., a Shift key and then a letter to produce a capital letter instead of having to hold down the Shift key. Many fast typists like this.
    </p><p>
        If you're fast enough you can even chain these OSMs, for instance tapping RCtrl, RShift and LeftArrow in rapid sequence to select the last word. But for that one I'd prefer using Extend+S+T+O to avoid reaching for the left arrow key. And I'm not sure you should use a sticky Ctrl key, in case you hit something destructive by accident.
    </p><p>
        On a side note, EPKL can be finicky about modifier remapping. All keys that are intended to work as OSMs or Extend release keys must be mapped in some way – such as setting them to 'Modifier', 'VirtualKey' or 'System' even if you don't want to map them further. But doing this with LCtrl and/or RAlt seems to mess with the AltGr functionality if you're using that. Also, the LAlt key often causes trouble in some apps if mapped. I tend to use the SharpKeys program to remap such keys; it's less elegant but very robust.
