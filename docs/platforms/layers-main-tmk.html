        A USB-2-USB device remaps only key strokes, not character input events. So key mods like layout and ergo remappings are possible, but not mods that send glyphs. Your dead keys and AltGr mappings will work as they do without the device, and you may only move their keys around as they are.
    </p><p>
        Sorry, but AltGr/DeadKey glyph mappings such as the powerful Colemak[eD] below are for the most part up to the active layout on the machine you're typing to.
    </p><p>
        In all honesty though, <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/wiki/FAQ-Keymap">it is possible to send Unicode</a> with methods such as Windows' Alt+NumPad(####) defined for instance as TMK macros. But since it's platform dependent, memory consuming and clunky, I couldn't do this to create the full Colemak[eD]. Dead key tables and functions would've been even more byte-gobbling, so no.
    </p><p>
        However, I have made a user function that lets you define a few keys as four-level giving OS specific Unicode input using the RAlt key as AltGr for these keys only. I used this to get the Norwegian special letters åæø and their shifted counterparts (on the bracket and ISO LSGT keys) as in Colemak[eD], and it works fine for me. I even added the bullet and dagger glyphs (on the ISO \| key) for good measure. You can find various lists of alt codes to use, such as <a href="https://fsymbols.com/keyboard/windows/alt-codes/list/">this one</a>. Remember that you need to use "KC_P#" where # is the digit. For Mac or Unix you need to change the method, see the unimap_dreymar.c file and ask me if you need help.

    The USB-2-USB implementation is almost the same as the Linux/XKB and Windows/PKL ones. Some advanced media key codes such as Brightness controls are missing for now (as their key codes aren't in TMK). How some of the advanced keys like MouseWheel Left/Right are interpreted is still up to the OS.

    Here's the Extend1 and Extend2 layer charts from my TMK source file:

        To use the Extend layers, define the CAPSBEHAVIOR constant to 1. This'll make CapsLock the Extend modifier. You may change it to another key by editing the active layout or keymap; see the <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/18410/#p18410">Configuration</a></b> post below.
    </p><p>
        <b>NOTE: Superstacking Extend modifiers</b> doesn't always work for me. Instead of Ctrl+Shift+Left, pressing Caps+S+T+N gave me ST key strokes. Oddly enough, it works with either Phys-Shift + Extend-Ctrl as well as Phys-RCtrl + Extend-Shift (Shift+Caps+T+N or RCtrl+Caps+S+N work) but not with physical LCtrl. This leads me to believe that the limitation is my keyboards' scan matrix, but it happened on all my boards. Other users didn't have this problem...?

        There's a couple of EXT#BIT constants that determine how Extend2 is selected: If EXT2BIT is defined as MOD_BIT(KC_RSFT) for instance, holding Right Shift down while pressing the Extend key will activate Extend2. Holding down Extend alone will maintain that layer. The EXT3BIT and the combination of the two could select Extend3 and Extend4, but I haven't yet implemented these layers as I haven't yet decided on what to put in them. You could add your own if you want to – ask me how.
    </p><p>
        For the NumPad layer, remember that the NumLock state influences what you get. There's a NumLock key easily accessible in the layer.
