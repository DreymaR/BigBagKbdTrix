<!-- Angle/Wide -->
<div class="platform-content" id="pfct-AngleWide">
    <p>
        I've implemented the ZXCVB_ 'Angle' shift for ISO keyboards both separately and as part of the AngleWide-ISO mod that I use myself. For ANSI boards I've made an implementation of the 'Angle(Z)' shift (moving the Z key to the middle) and a Wide-ANSI mod as well as the combination of these. Also the 'A-Wing' mod to get the Angle and right pinky benefits without messing with the Z position (but at other costs such as left pinky stretches; I'm not a fan myself).
    </p><p>
        To use one of these, define the Unimap layout constant in my keymap (.c) file:
    </p>
    
     <pre><code>
    Edit '_########' in the UNIMAPLAYOUT definiton below to choose ergonomic Curl/Angle/Wide keyboard mods:
    _NOMODS - Standard Unimap format for all keyboard and converter types (w/o F13-24; this one is without ergo mods)
    _ISO_A_ - ISO/Int Angle (the simple lower left half-row shift)
    _ISO_AW - ISO/Int Angle-Wide(/)
    _ANS_A_ - ANSI/US Angle(Z)
    _ANS_AW - ANSI/US Angle(Z)-Wide(')
    _AWINGA - ANSI/US A-Wing Angle (rarely used)
    
    Select an ergo modded keymap, or the plain unmodded Unimap. Note that these maps affect all layouts and layers.
    For Curl(DH), you also need to set CURLMOD. For Sym mods, set SYMBOLKEYS according to keymap.
    To get, say, the Colemak-CAWS (CurlAngleWideSym) layout on ISO/ANSI, use the _###_AW keymap with
        ACTIVELAYOUT 5, CURLMOD 1 and SYMBOLKEYS 2/3 settings below. And CAPSBEHAVIOR 1 for Extend, of course!
    </code></pre>
    
     <p>
         The actual keymap types are defined in the header (.h) file as compiler macros and those are a bit harder to edit manually.
     </p>

<!-- Curl-DH -->
<div class="platform-content" id="pfct-Curl-DH">
    <p>
        To use Colemak-DH with my TMK files, there's a preprocessor switch named CURLMOD:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>
    The CURLMOD options for Colemak and Tarmak layouts are:
    0: No Curl - "vanilla" Colemak/Tarmak
    1: SteveP99's original Curl(DHm) ergo mod, bringing D/H down but M to the home row. DH standard since Oct 2020.
...
#define CURLMOD         1                       /* CURL_DH          */
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>
        This switch only affects Colemak layouts, including the four Tarmak layouts and Mirrored Colemak. It also effects a V-B swap for Extend, so the Ctrl+V shortcut is kept.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- Sym -->
<div class="platform-content" id="pfct-Sym">
    <p>
        The Symbol key mods are selected with the SYMBOLKEYS setting. The Sym mod depends on your keymap, so select the right one depending on your Wide mod and board type.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- Modifiers -->
<div class="platform-content" id="pfct-Modifiers">
    <p>I've implemented Sticky Shift but not much else for TMK. See the repo files/docs. Moving modifiers around shouldn't be hard to do if you're interested.</p>
