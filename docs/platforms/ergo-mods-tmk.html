<!-- Angle/Wide -->
<div class="platform-content">
    <p>
        I've implemented the ZXCVB_ 'Angle' shift for ISO keyboards both separately and as part of the AngleWide(ISO/Slash) mod that I use myself. For ANSI boards I've made an implementation of the 'Angle(Z)' shift (moving the Z key to the middle) and a Wide(ANSI/Quote) mod as well as the combination of these. Also the 'A-Wing' mod to get the Angle and right pinky benefits without messing with the Z position (but at other costs such as left pinky stretches; I'm not a fan myself).
    </p><p>
        Colemak-DH requires by default a special Angle(Wide) variant in which the V is kept in its original position so that only ZXC and B move; B then gets remapped to D by the mod itself. See below.
    </p><p>
        To use one of these, define the Unimap layout constant in my keymap (.c) file:
    </p>
    
     <pre><code>
* Edit '_########' in the UNIMAPLAYOUT definiton below to choose ergonomic Curl/Angle/Wide keyboard mods:
* _UNMODDED - Standard Unimap format for all keyboard and converter types (w/o F13-24; this one is without ergo mods)
* _ISO__A__ (w/ Curl-DH: _ISO_CA__) - ISO/Int Angle (the simple lower left half-row shift)
* _ISO__AW_ (w/ Curl-DH: _ISO_CAW_) - ISO/Int Angle-Wide(/)
* _ISO_CAWS                         - ISO/Int Curl-Angle-Wide(/)-Sym (more accessible apostrophe and hyphen/minus)
* _ANS__A__ (w/ Curl-DH: _ANS_CA__) - ANSI/US Angle(Z)
* _ANS__AW_ (w/ Curl-DH: _ANS_CAW_) - ANSI/US Angle(Z)-Wide(')
* _ANSAWING (   Curl-DH:  N/A     ) - ANSI/US A-Wing
*
* Select a Curl(DH) or non-Curl ergo model, or plain unmodded Unimap. For Curl(DH), you also need to set CURLMOD.
* NOTE: These map layouts affect all layouts. So for instance the CAWS map will affect both Colemak and Extend.

     <p>
         The actual keymap types are defined in the header (.h) file as compiler macros and those are a bit harder to edit manually.

<!-- Curl-DH -->
<div class="platform-content">
    <p>
        To use Colemak-DH with my TMK files, there's a preprocessor switch named CURLMOD:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>
* The CURLMOD options for Colemak and Tarmak layouts are:
* 0: No Curl - vanilla Colemak/Tarmak
* 1: The 2017 Curl(DHk) ergo mod, bringing the D and H keys down to comfortable bottom-row positions (QWERTY C/M)
* 2: SteveP99's original Curl(DHm) ergo mod, bringing D/H down but M to the home row. DH standard since Oct 2020.
...
#define CURLMOD 1
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>
        This switch only affects Colemak layouts, including the four Tarmak layouts and Mirrored Colemak. Make sure you use a CurlAngle or CurlAngleWide keymap type such as <i>UNIMAP_AWIZXCBV</i> with it (optional for Tarmak1).
    </p>
</div>

<!-- Sym -->
<div class="platform-content">
    <p>
        The fairly optional "Sym" symbol key mod hasn't been fully implemented in my TMK files. There's a model for CAWS-ISO that may serve as a template if you want another variant. But note that models affect Extend layers and other layouts too! So you may be better off just editing the layout definitions directly instead.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
  \   7   8   9   0   =
[   j   l   u   y   '   -
 ]   m   n   e   i   o   ;
   /   k   h   ,   .   _____
    </code></pre>

   <p class="italic">
       The "Sym" symbol rotation mod together with the Curl-DH and AngleWide(ISO) mods is <b>Colemak-CAWS</b>.
   </p>
</div>

<!-- Modifiers -->
<div class="platform-content">
    <p>I've implemented Sticky Shift but not much else for TMK. See the repo files/docs. Moving modifiers around shouldn't be hard to do if you're interested.</p>
