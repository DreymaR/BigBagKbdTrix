[h]Tarmak for Curl-DH mods![/h]
[h]NOTE (2017): These are now outdated, and superseded by the new Colemak-DH mod![/h]

As [url=https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=14803#p14803]mentioned further up in this topic[/url], my Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks holds a new trick or two: The Curl-DH mods invented by Stevep99! For those who didn't know: These mods move the D and H from the middle "trench" which several users have found hard to reach, to the lower row positions of Colemak B/K or V/M which some – myself included – find much better than their "non-home-row" reputations. I'm using the Curl-DbgHk mod and liking it a lot.

These mods move a couple more keys than standard Colemak but keep all finger assignments. Also, by keeping the G in its QWERTY place the number of extra key movements is reduced by one. My preferred mod (Curl-DbgHk) moves only 18 keys to Colemak's 17 if you don't count the Angle mod (as the ZXCV keys all keep their finger assignments!). That's very much worth it to me.

It's of course a bit worrying that the newcomer to the Colemak world faces yet another daunting choice! But we know that the DH keys have given newcomers pause before, and this has been a contributory factor to the creation of IMNSHO unnecessary layouts such as Workman and Norman. I feel it's important that this choice of getting the full benefits of Colemak with DH mods at a low cost is available.

For the right-hand "H" part of the mod, I recommend getting the Hk switch with Tarmak1 if you go for my mod variant (DbgHk), but if you use Steve's variant (Dvbg/Hm) you may do the right-hand mod whenever you feel like as the Hm switch only affects keys not moved by Colemak! It's after all a relatively minor but also very simple improvement so just search your feelings. ;-)

The left-hand "D" mod should be done with Tarmak2 as that's where the G is normally moved which we don't want in this case. Moving B instead triggers the inclusion of the Angle mod. However, that makes this step rather large. It's possible to split step 2 if that feels like a hurdle (although the ZXCV keys don't change fingering but only wrist angle in the process). The easiest way of doing that would be to first learn the Angle mod (B>V>C>X>Z>_) separately, at the small cost of a little more B confusion. Using Steve's variant the V stays in its old place and isn't part of the Angle mod (at the cost of splitting it from ZXC).


[b]Implementations[/b]
[b]Linux/XKB:[/b] Tarmak needs a few tweaks, but nothing major! In the Linux world you can turn on the D(v)bg and Hk/Hm switches separately which makes implementation quite simple requiring only a tweak in step 2. See the symbols/colemak file or the XKB Big Bag topic.
[Update: You can now select the modified step 2 directly as Tarmak2bk/vm; there's also a Tarmak1k. For the other Tarmak steps, use options or edit the colemak file, and/or select models with the setkb.sh script.]

[b]Windows/PKL:[/b] For PKL you'll have to comment/uncomment some lines in the layout.ini file and if your layout doesn't have the necessary lines you can find them in the Colemak-ISO AngleWide file as the Curl mod is a development on the Angle mod and I expect that most Curl modders will also go with the Wide mod!

For the technically inclined, here's what the key change loops look like with the Curl-DH mods included (on ANSI boards, ignore '_'):
[code]
Colemak[Angle] loops:  Y>O>;>P  >  R>S>D  >            G>T>F  >  E>K>N>J       L>U>I     [B>V>C>X>Z>_]
Colemak-DH     loops:  Y>O>;>P  >  R>S>D  >    C>X>Z>_>B>T>F  >  E>K>H>M>N>J   L>U>I
Colemak-DbgHk  loops:  Y>O>;>P  >  R>S>D  >  V>C>X>Z>_>B>T>F  >  E>K>H>N>J     L>U>I
Colemak-DvbgHm loops:  Y>O>;>P  >  R>S>D  >    C>X>Z>_>B>T>F  >  E>K>N>J       L>U>I     H>M
